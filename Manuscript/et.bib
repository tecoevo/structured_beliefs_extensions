	abstract = {{The dependence of hunter-gatherers on local net primary production (NPP) to provide food played a major role in shaping long-term human population dynamics. Observations of contemporary hunter-gatherers have shown an overall correlation between population density and annual NPP but with a 1,000-fold variation in population density per unit NPP that remains unexplained. Here, we build a process-based hunter-gatherer population model embedded within a global terrestrial biosphere model, which explicitly addresses the extraction of NPP through dynamically allocated hunting and gathering activities. The emergent results reveal a strong, previously unrecognized effect of seasonality on population density via diet composition, whereby hunter-gatherers consume high fractions of meat in regions where growing seasons are short, leading to greatly reduced population density due to trophic inefficiency. This seasonal carnivory bottleneck largely explains the wide variation in population density per unit NPP and questions the prevailing usage of annual NPP as the proxy of carrying capacity for ancient humans. Our process-based approach has the potential to greatly refine our understanding of dynamical responses of ancient human populations to past environmental changes. The authors construct a process-based hunter-gatherer population model embedded within a global terrestrial biosphere model that reveals a strong effect of growing season length on population density via diet composition.}},

	abstract = {Abstract Mutualistic interactions among members of different species are common, seemingly stable, and thus apparently enduring. This is at odds with standard mathematical models based solely on between-species interactions, which show mutualisms to be inherently unstable. Models incorporating parameters for punishment and reward strategies demonstrate that the range of conditions over which stability is observed can be extended; however, the role of community-level dynamics impacted by within-species interactions remains relatively unexplored. Here we develop a general and readily applicable approach for analysing a broad range of mutualisms. By incorporating within-species interactions, we show that mutualisms can be stably maintained across diverse environmental conditions without introducing changes to between-species interaction parameters. Further, a balance of within- and between-species interactions is sufficient to allow the persistence of mutualisms encountering ecological perturbations. Our simple and robust framework resonates with emerging empirical data highlighting the role of community-level interactions and population dynamics in maintaining mutualisms.},

	abstract = {{The transition to agriculture is one of the most significant events in human prehistory; yet, explaining why people initially domesticated plants and animals remains a contentious research problem in archaeology. Two competing hypotheses dominate current debates. The first draws on niche construction theory to emphasize how intentional management of wild resources should lead to domestication regardless of Malthusian population--resource imbalances. The second relies on models from behavioural ecology (BE) to highlight how individuals should only exert selective pressure on wild resources during times of population--resource imbalance. We examine these hypotheses to explain the domestication event which occurred in Eastern North America approximately 5000 years ago. Using radiocarbon date density and site counts as proxies for human population, we find that populations increased significantly in the 1000 years prior to initial domestication. We therefore suggest that high populations prior to 5000 cal BP may have experienced competition for and possibly overexploitation of resources, altering the selective pressures on wild plants thereby producing domesticates. These findings support the BE hypothesis of domestication occurring in the context of population--resource imbalances. Such deficits, driven either by increased populations or decreased resource abundance, are predicted to characterize domestication events elsewhere.}},

	abstract = {{The conditional strategy is a theoretical framework that explains the existence within populations of individuals that express alternative behavioral, physical or life history tactics (phenotypes). An example is fighters and sneakers in many animal mating systems. In the conditional strategy the alternative tactics are chosen by individuals based on their state, for example large or small bodied. Since state is often heritable, due for example to additive genetic variance, the alternative tactics may also have inheritance. As the tactics do not have equal fitnesses, it is generally believed that any such inheritance would prevent the evolutionary stability of the conditional strategy. However, in previous work we introduced an Inheritance Theorem and were able to prove that a conditional strategy with tactic inheritances can have a unique equilibrium proportion of the tactics. We now prove a second property of our Inheritance Theorem, namely the stability of the equilibrium. This means that if the tactics are perturbed from their equilibrium proportions, they will return across generations to their equilibrium proportions. An example is provided in mites. We have therefore established an Inheritance Theorem which includes both the existence of an equilibrium and its stability for alternative tactics in a conditional strategy.}},

	abstract = {Counterfactual Thinking is a human cognitive ability studied in a wide variety of domains. It captures the process of reasoning about a past event that did not occur, namely what would have happened had this event occurred, or, otherwise, to reason about an event that did occur but what would ensue had it not. Given the wide cognitive empowerment of counterfactual reasoning in the human individual, the question arises of how the presence of individuals with this capability may improve cooperation in populations of self-regarding individuals. Here we propose a mathematical model, grounded on Evolutionary Game Theory, to examine the population dynamics emerging from the interplay between counterfactual thinking and social learning (i.e., individuals that learn from the actions and success of others) whenever the individuals in the population face a collective dilemma. Our results suggest that counterfactual reasoning fosters coordination in collective action problems occurring in large populations, and has a limited impact on cooperation dilemmas in which coordination is not required. Moreover, we show that a small prevalence of individuals resorting to counterfactual thinking is enough to nudge an entire population towards highly cooperative standards.},

	abstract = {{The origins of religion and of complex societies represent evolutionary puzzles1--8. The `moralizing gods' hypothesis offers a solution to both puzzles by proposing that belief in morally concerned supernatural agents culturally evolved to facilitate cooperation among strangers in large-scale societies9--13. Although previous research has suggested an association between the presence of moralizing gods and social complexity3,6,7,9--18, the relationship between the two is disputed9--13,19--24, and attempts to establish causality have been hampered by limitations in the availability of detailed global longitudinal data. To overcome these limitations, here we systematically coded records from 414 societies that span the past 10,000 years from 30 regions around the world, using 51 measures of social complexity and 4 measures of supernatural enforcement of morality. Our analyses not only confirm the association between moralizing gods and social complexity, but also reveal that moralizing gods follow---rather than precede---large increases in social complexity. Contrary to previous predictions9,12,16,18, powerful moralizing `big gods' and prosocial supernatural punishment tend to appear only after the emergence of `megasocieties' with populations of more than around one million people. Moralizing gods are not a prerequisite for the evolution of social complexity, but they may help to sustain and expand complex multi-ethnic empires after they have become established. By contrast, rituals that facilitate the standardization of religious traditions across large populations25,26 generally precede the appearance of moralizing gods. This suggests that ritual practices were more important than the particular content of religious belief to the initial rise of social complexity. Belief in moralizing gods followed the expansion of human societies and may have been preceded by doctrinal rituals that contributed to the initial rise of social complexity.}},

	abstract = {{Conformist bias occurs when the probability of adopting a more common cultural variant in a population exceeds its frequency, and anticonformist bias occurs when the reverse is true. Conformist and anticonformist bias have been widely documented in humans, and conformist bias has also been observed in many nonhuman animals. Boyd and Richerson used models of conformist and anticonformist bias to explain the evolution of large-scale cooperation, and subsequent research has extended these models. We revisit Boyd and Richerson's original analysis and show that, with conformity based on more than three role models, the evolutionary dynamics can be more complex than previously assumed. For example, we show the presence of stable cycles and chaos under strong anticonformity and the presence of new equilibria when both conformity and anticonformity act at different variant frequencies, with and without selection. We also investigate the case of population subdivision with migration and find that the common claim that conformity can maintain between-group differences is not always true. Therefore, the effect of conformity on the evolution of cooperation by group selection may be more complicated than previously stated. Finally, using Feldman and Liberman's modifier approach, we investigate the conditions under which a rare modifier of the extent of conformity or the number of role models can invade a population. Understanding the dynamics of conformist- and anticonformist-biased transmission may have implications for research on human and nonhuman animal behavior, the evolution of cooperation, and frequency-dependent transmission in general.}},

The resulting extension of signalling theory---called `charismatic signalling'---directs attention to potential cooperative benefits from religion's fascinating and diverse effects on the body. The charismatic signalling model is presented as a `how-possibly model', not as a `just-so story'.

	abstract = {{In recent years, the phenomenon of cumulative cultural evolution (CCE) has become the focus of major research interest in biology, psychology and anthropology. Some researchers argue that CCE is unique to humans and underlies our extraordinary evolutionary success as a species. Others claim to have found CCE in non-human species. Yet others remain sceptical that CCE is even important for explaining human behavioural diversity and complexity. These debates are hampered by multiple and often ambiguous definitions of CCE. Here, we review how researchers define, use and test CCE. We identify a core set of criteria for CCE which are both necessary and sufficient, and may be found in non-human species. We also identify a set of extended criteria that are observed in human CCE but not, to date, in other species. Different socio-cognitive mechanisms may underlie these different criteria.

This paper identifies two traditions in monetary theory that have tried to answer that question. On the one hand, the money or non-money view follows a strategy proposed by a version of philosophical essentialism, in which there is a set of defining characteristics of money that make it categorically different from other things used in transactions. On the other hand, the liquidity degree view emphasizes that the multiple objects that circulate as a means of payment differ in their degree of acceptability. Since there is no absolute standard of liquidity, a precise dividing line between money and non-money cannot be drawn. We challenge the money or non-money view, arguing that there is nothing in the nature of money that can be interpreted as a natural kind essence by which money can be categorically separated from non-money.}},

In this paper I reconstruct the pattern of change in marriage strategies in the history of societies speaking Indo-European languages, using cross-cultural data in the systematic and explicitly historical framework afforded by the phylogenetic comparative approach. The analysis provides evidence in support of Proto-Indo-European monogamy, and that this pattern may have extended back to Proto-Indo-Hittite. These reconstructions push the origin of monogamous marriage into prehistory, well beyond the earliest instances documented in the historical record; this, in turn, challenges notions that the cross-cultural distribution of monogamous marriage reflects features of social organization typically associated with Eurasian societies, and with "societal complexity" and "modernization" more generally. I discuss implications of these findings in the context of the archaeological and genetic evidence on prehistoric social organization.}},

	abstract = {{Storytelling represents a key element in the creation and propagation of culture. Three main accounts of the adaptive function of storytelling include (a) manipulating the behavior of the audience to enhance the fitness of the narrator, (b) transmitting survival‐relevant information while avoiding the costs involved in the first‐hand acquisition of that information, and (c) maintaining social bonds or group‐level cooperation. We assess the substantial evidence collected in experimental and ethnographic studies for each account. These accounts do not always appeal to the specific features of storytelling above and beyond language use in general. We propose that the specific adaptive value of storytelling lies in making sense of non‐routine, uncertain, or novel situations, thereby enabling the collaborative development of previously acquired skills and knowledge, but also promoting social cohesion by strengthening intragroup identity and clarifying intergroup relations. Bietti, Tilston and Bangerter take an evolutionary approach towards memory transmission and storytelling, arguing that storytelling plays a central role in the creation and transmission of cultural information. They suggest that storytelling is a vehicle to transmit survival‐related information that helps to avoid the costs involved in the first‐hand acquisition of that information and contributes to the maintenance of social bonds and group‐level cooperation. Furthermore, Bietti et al. argue that, going beyond storytelling's individualist role of manipulating the audience to enhance fitness of the narrator, that these adaptive functions of storytelling may well be assigned to other forms of language use besides narration (e.g., instructional discourse and argumentation). Based on this evidence, Bietti and colleagues claim that the specific adaptive function of storytelling lies in making sense of non‐routine, uncertain, or novel situations, thereby enabling collective sensemaking.}},

Yet, the extent to which the advent of agriculture affected the evolution of the human immune system remains unknown. Here we present a comparative study of variation in the transcriptional responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to bacterial and viral stimuli between Batwa rainforest hunter-gatherers and Bakiga agriculturalists from Uganda. We observed increased divergence between hunter-gatherers and agriculturalists in the early transcriptional response to viruses compared with that for bacterial stimuli. We demonstrate that a significant fraction of these transcriptional differences are under genetic control and we show that positive natural selection has helped to shape population differences in immune regulation. Across the set of genetic variants underlying inter-population immune-response differences, however, the signatures of positive selection were disproportionately observed in the rainforest hunter-gatherers. This result is counter to expectations on the basis of the popularized notion that shifts in pathogen exposure due to the advent of agriculture imposed radically heightened selective pressures in agriculturalist populations.},

	abstract = {This week's Review Article tackles the question of the evolution of human pathogens. Analysis of what we know of the origins of 10 tropical and 15 temperate infectious diseases reveals that animals were the source of the majority of important human diseases in the recent past, and that direct contact with animals through activities such as hunting remains a major route for disease acquisition. Modern developments such as industrial food production, vaccine production and blood transfusion may be making us more vulnerable than ever to new pathogens. The authors argue that people with high exposure to wild animals, such as hunters, zoo workers and wildlife veterinarians, should be regularly screened for emergent pathogens.This would provide early warning of newly introduced disease, and supply a repository of tissue samples that would assist in reconstructing the origin of later outbreaks. Many of the major human infectious diseases, including some now confined to humans and absent from animals, are `new' ones that arose only after the origins of agriculture. Where did they come from? Why are they overwhelmingly of Old World origins? Here we show that answers to these questions are different for tropical and temperate diseases; for instance, in the relative importance of domestic animals and wild primates as sources. We identify five intermediate stages through which a pathogen exclusively infecting animals may become transformed into a pathogen exclusively infecting humans. We propose an initiative to resolve disputed origins of major diseases, and a global early warning system to monitor pathogens infecting individuals exposed to wild animals.},

@article{pearce-Duvet:BioRev:2006,
	abstract = {Many significant diseases of human civilization are thought to have arisen concurrently with the advent of agriculture in human society. It has been hypothesised that the food produced by farming increased population sizes to allow the maintenance of virulent pathogens, i.e. civilization pathogens, while domestic animals provided sources of disease to humans. To determine the relationship between pathogens in humans and domestic animals, I examined phylogenetic data for several human pathogens that are commonly evolutionarily linked to domestic animals: measles, pertussis, smallpox, tuberculosis, taenid worms, and falciparal malaria. The majority are civilization pathogens, although I have included others whose evolutionary origins have traditionally been ascribed to domestic animals. The strongest evidence for a domestic-animal origin exists for measles and pertussis, although the data do not exclude a non-domestic origin. As for the other pathogens, the evidence currently available makes it difficult to determine if the domestic-origin hypothesis is supported or refuted; in fact, intriguing data for tuberculosis and taenid worms suggests that transmission may occur as easily from humans to domestic animals. These findings do not abrogate the importance of agriculture in disease transmission; rather, if anything, they suggest an alternative, more complex series of effects than previously elucidated. Rather than domestication, the broader force for human pathogen evolution could be ecological change, namely anthropogenic modification of the environment. This is supported by evidence that many current emerging infectious diseases are associated with human modification of the environment. Agriculture may have changed the transmission ecology of pre-existing human pathogens, increased the success of pre-existing pathogen vectors, resulted in novel interactions between humans and wildlife, and, through the domestication of animals, provided a stable conduit for human infection by wildlife diseases.},

Recent research demonstrates that this assumption is incorrect. With the development of sedentism and the intensification of agriculture, there is an increase in infectious disease and nutritional deficiencies particularly affecting infants and children. Declining health probably increased mortality among infants, children and oldest adults. However, the productive and reproductive core would have been able to respond to this increase in mortality by reducing birth spacing. That is, agricultural populations increased in size, despite higher mortality, because intervals between births became shorter.},

	abstract = {We study a simple agent-based model of the recurring fashion cycles in the society that consists of two interacting communities: "snobs" and "followers" (or "opinion hunters", hence the name of the model). Followers conform to all other individuals, whereas snobs conform only to their own group and anticonform to the other. The model allows to examine the role of the social structure, i.e. the influence of the number of inter-links between the two communities, as well as the role of the stability of links. The latter is accomplished by considering two versions of the same model-quenched (parameterized by fraction L of fixed inter-links) and annealed (parameterized by probability p that a given inter-link exists). Using Monte Carlo simulations and analytical treatment (the latter only for the annealed model), we show that there is a critical fraction of inter-links, above which recurring cycles occur. For p ≤ 0.5 we derive a relation between parameters L and p that allows to compare both models and show that the critical value of inter-connections, p*, is the same for both versions of the model (annealed and quenched) but the period of a fashion cycle is shorter for the quenched model. Near the critical point, the cycles are irregular and a change of fashion is difficult to predict. For the annealed model we also provide a deeper theoretical analysis. We conjecture on topological grounds that the so-called saddle node heteroclinic bifurcation appears at p*. For p ≥ 0.5 we show analytically the existence of the second critical value of p, for which the system undergoes Hopf's bifurcation.},

	n2 = {Evolutionary researchers have recently suggested that pre-modern human societies habitually practised cooperative breeding and that this feature helps explain human prosocial tendencies. Despite circumstantial evidence that post-reproductive females and extra-pair males both provide resources required for successful reproduction by mated pairs, no study has yet provided details about the flow of food resources by different age and sex categories to breeders and offspring, nor documented the ratio of helpers to breeders. Here, we show in two hunter--gatherer societies of South America that each breeding pair with dependent offspring on average obtained help from approximately 1.3 non-reproductive adults. Young married males and unmarried males of all ages were the main food providers, accounting for 93--100{\%} of all excess food production available to breeding pairs and their offspring. Thus, each breeding pair with dependants was provisioned on average by 0.8 adult male helpers. The data provide no support for the hypothesis that post-reproductive females are the main provisioners of younger reproductive-aged kin in hunter--gatherer societies. Demographic and food acquisition data show that most breeding pairs can expect food deficits owing to foraging luck, health disabilities and accumulating dependency ratio of offspring in middle age, and that extra-pair provisioning may be essential to the evolved human life history.},

@article{frenkel:PNAS:2015,
	abstract = {The spontaneous emergence of stable coexistence between competing lineages in experimental evolution illustrates principles behind the creation and maintenance of biodiversity. Here, we present the first experimental observation of a general mechanism that leads to stable diversification in microbial populations despite competition for shared resources. Coexistence in our system depends on a tradeoff between growth and the ability to avoid cellular crowding. We elucidate the biophysical and genetic basis of this coexistence, and introduce a mathematical model that explains our results. Our analysis demonstrates that this coexistence can be perturbed by evolution on longer time scales, providing a unique quantitative example of how the interactions between ecological and evolutionary processes can create and destroy diversity in microbial populations.Identifying the mechanisms that create and maintain biodiversity is a central challenge in biology. Stable diversification of microbial populations often requires the evolution of differences in resource utilization. Alternatively, coexistence can be maintained by specialization to exploit spatial heterogeneity in the environment. Here, we report spontaneous diversification maintained by a related but distinct mechanism: crowding avoidance. During experimental evolution of laboratory Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations, we observed the repeated appearance of {\textquotedblleft}adherent{\textquotedblright} (A) lineages able to grow as a dispersed film, in contrast to their crowded {\textquotedblleft}bottom-dweller{\textquotedblright} (B) ancestors. These two types stably coexist because dispersal reduces interference competition for nutrients among kin, at the cost of a slower maximum growth rate. This tradeoff causes the frequencies of the two types to oscillate around equilibrium over the course of repeated cycles of growth, crowding, and dispersal. However, further coevolution of the A and B types can perturb and eventually destroy their coexistence over longer time scales. We introduce a simple mathematical model of this {\textquotedblleft}semistable{\textquotedblright} coexistence, which explains the interplay between ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Because crowded growth generally limits nutrient access in biofilms, the mechanism we report here may be broadly important in maintaining diversity in these natural environments.},

Here, we reevaluate the ordinary differential equations used previously to model plasmid persistence and conclude that the parameter space required for maintenance is far less stringent than has been supposed. Strikingly, our model demonstrates that purely parasitic plasmids may persist, even in the absence of heterogeneity in the host population, and that this persistence is expressed by oscillations or damped oscillations between the plasmid-bearing and the plasmid-free class.},

	abstractnote = {Predicting the repeatability of evolution remains elusive. Theory and empirical studies suggest that strong selection and large population sizes increase the probability for parallel evolution at the phenotypic and genotypic levels. However, selection and population sizes are not constant, but rather change continuously and directly affect each other even on short time scales. Here, we examine the degree of parallel evolution shaped through ecoevolutionary dynamics in an algal host population coevolving with a virus. We find high degrees of parallelism at the level of population size changes (ecology) and at the phenotypic level between replicated populations. At the genomic level, we find evidence for parallelism, as the same large genomic region was duplicated in all replicated populations, but also substantial novel sequence divergence between replicates. These patterns of genome evolution can be explained by considering population size changes as an important driver of rapid evolution.},

	abstract = {The theory that coevolving hosts and parasites create a fluctuating selective environment for one another (i.e., produce Red Queen dynamics) has deep roots in evolutionary biology; yet empirical evidence for Red Queen dynamics remains scarce. Fluctuating coevolutionary dynamics underpin the Red Queen hypothesis for the evolution of sex, as well as hypotheses explaining the persistence of genetic variation under sexual selection, local parasite adaptation, the evolution of mutation rate, and the evolution of nonrandom mating. Coevolutionary models that exhibit Red Queen dynamics typically assume that hosts and parasites encounter one another randomly. However, if related individuals aggregate into family groups or are clustered spatially, related hosts will be more likely to encounter parasites transmitted by genetically similar individuals. Using a model that incorporates familial parasite transmission, we show that a slight degree of familial parasite transmission is sufficient to halt coevolutionary fluctuations. Our results predict that evidence for Red Queen dynamics, and its evolutionary consequences, are most likely to be found in biological systems in which hosts and parasites mix mainly at random, and are less likely to be found in systems with familial aggregation. This presents a challenge to the Red Queen hypothesis and other hypotheses that depend on coevolutionary cycling.},

	abstract = {Abstract Abiotic environmental heterogeneity can promote the evolution of diverse resource specialists, which in turn may increase the degree of host--parasite specialization. We coevolved Pseudomonas fluorescens and lytic phage ϕ2 in spatially structured populations, each consisting of two interconnected subpopulations evolving in the same or different nutrient media (homogeneous and heterogeneous environments, respectively). Counter to the normal expectation, host--parasite specialization was significantly lower in heterogeneous compared with homogeneous environments. This result could not be explained by dispersal homogenizing populations, as this would have resulted in the heterogeneous treatments having levels of specialization equal to or greater than that of the homogeneous environments. We argue that selection for costly generalists is greatest when the coevolving species are exposed to diverse environmental conditions and that this can provide an explanation for our results. A simple coevolutionary model of this process suggests that this can be a general mechanism by which environmental heterogeneity can reduce rather than increase host--parasite specialization.},

	abstract = {Why are some diseases more virulent than others? Vector{\textendash}borne diseases such as malaria and water{\textendash}borne diseases such as cholera are generally more virulent than diseases spread by direct contagion. One factor that characterizes both vector{\textendash} and water{\textendash}borne diseases is their ability to spread over long distances, thus causing infection of susceptible individuals distant from the infected individual. Here we show that this ability of the pathogen to infect distant individuals in a spatially structured host population leads to the evolution of a more virulent pathogen. We use a lattice model in which reproduction is local but infection can vary between completely local to completely global. With completely global infection the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) is the same as in mean{\textendash}field models while a lower virulence is predicted as infection becomes more local. There is characteristically a period of relatively moderate increase in virulence followed by a more rapid rise with increasing proportions of global infection as we move beyond a {\textquoteleft}critical connectivity{\textquoteright}. In the light of recent work emphasizing the existence of {\textquoteleft}small world{\textquoteright} networks in human populations, our results suggests that if the world is getting {\textquoteleft}smaller{\textquoteright} (as populations become more connected) diseases may evolve higher virulence.},

	abstract = { Abstract: Understanding the effect of multiple infections is essential for the prediction (and eventual control) of virulence evolution. Some theoretical studies have considered the possibility that several strains coexist in the same host (coinfection), but few have taken their within‐host dynamics explicitly into account. Here, we develop a nested approach based on a simple model for the interaction of parasite strains with their host's immune system. We study virulence evolution by linking the within‐host dynamics to an epidemiological framework that incorporates multiple infections. Our model suggests that antigenically similar parasite strains cannot coexist in the long term inside a host. We also find that the optimal level of virulence increases with the efficiency of multiple infections. Finally, we notice that coinfections create heterogeneity in the host population (with susceptible hosts and infected hosts), which can lead to evolutionary branching in the parasite population and the emergence of a hypervirulent parasite strategy. We interpret this result as a parasite specialization to the infectious state of the hosts. Our study has experimental and theoretical implications in a virulence management perspective. },

	abstract = {Displaying images of eyes causes people to behave more pro-socially in a variety of contexts. However, it is unclear whether eyes work by making people universally more pro-social, or by making them more likely to conform to local norms. If the latter, images of eyes could sometimes make people less pro-social if pro-social behaviour is not the local norm. To separate these hypotheses we conducted a field experiment in which we explored whether manipulating a local descriptive norm altered the eyes effect. We recorded litter dropping decisions on a university campus in a 2 x 2 design, comparing situations with and without litter already on the ground (a manipulation of the local descriptive norm) and with and without large signs displaying images of watching eyes. We additionally recorded the number of potential human observers in the vicinity at the time of each littering decision. We observed a norm effect: the presence of litter on the ground increased littering, replicating previous findings. We also found that images of watching eyes reduced littering, although contrary to previous findings this was only when there were larger numbers of people around. With regard to our central aim, we found no evidence that litter on the ground interacted non-additively with images of eyes to induce increased littering behaviour. Our data therefore support the hypothesis that images of eyes induce more pro-social behaviour, independent of local norms. This finding has positive implications for the application of eye images in combating anti-social behaviour.},

	abstract = {The theory of selection on multivariate traits in age-structured populations has important implications for empirical and theoretical studies of life-history evolution. A model of natural selection on a set of correlated quantitative traits with age structure is derived here, using an extension of previous work on selection at a single locus. This formulation provides an equation for the change of the mean of a vector of traits that is accurate is selection is weak, and does not require the population always to be in demographic equilibrium as selection proceeds. The treatment is extended to density-dependent populations, and to equilibrium populations under frequency-dependent selection. In addition, further approximations are derived that produce evolutionary equilibria equivalent to those predicted by optimization and evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) theory. It is shown that the conditions for equilibrium are valid even if selection is strong.},

	abstract = {Many seemingly different questions that arise in the analysis of population change can be phrased as the same technical question: How, within a given demographic model, would variable y change if the age- or time-specific function f were to change arbitrarily in shape and intensity? At present demography lacks the machinery to answer this question in analytical and general form. This paper suggests a method based on modern functional calculus for deriving closed-form expressions for the sensitivity of demographic variables to changes in input functions or schedules. It uses this ``linkage method'' to obtain closed-form expressions for the response of the intrinsic growth rate, birth rate, and age composition of a stable population to arbitrary marginal changes in its age patterns of fertility and mortality. It uses it also to obtain expressions for the transient response of the age composition of a nonstable population to time-varying changes in the birth sequence, and to age-specific fertility and mortality patterns that change over time. The problem of ``bias'' in period vital rates is also looked at.},

	abstract = {The stable population model is used to establish formulas expressing the effects of mortality change on population growth rates, birth rates, and age composition. The change in the intrinsic growth rate is shown to be quite accurately approximated by the average decline in age-specific death rates between age zero and the mean age at childbearing in the stable population. This change is essentially independent of the initial level of fertility in the population. Changes in birth rates and age composition are shown to be simple functions of the age pattern of cumulative changes in mortality rates relative to an appropriately defined "neutral" standard.},

Although the expert estimates highlight large uncertainty, they allocate significant probability to some of the events listed above. We deduce conservative lower bounds for the probability of triggering at least 1 of those events of 0.16 for medium (2-4 degrees C), and 0.56 for high global mean temperature change (above 4 degrees C) relative to year 2000 levels.},

	abstract = {Deception is common in nature and humans are no exception. Modern societies have created institutions to control cheating, but many situations remain where only intrinsic honesty keeps people from cheating and violating rules. Psychological, sociological and economic theories suggest causal pathways to explain how the prevalence of rule violations in people's social environment, such as corruption, tax evasion or political fraud, can compromise individual intrinsic honesty. Here we present cross-societal experiments from 23 countries around the world that demonstrate a robust link between the prevalence of rule violations and intrinsic honesty. We developed an index of the 'prevalence of rule violations' (PRV) based on country-level data from the year 2003 of corruption, tax evasion and fraudulent politics. We measured intrinsic honesty in an anonymous die-rolling experiment. We conducted the experiments with 2,568 young participants (students) who, due to their young age in 2003, could not have influenced PRV in 2003. We find individual intrinsic honesty is stronger in the subject pools of low PRV countries than those of high PRV countries. The details of lying patterns support psychological theories of honesty. The results are consistent with theories of the cultural co-evolution of institutions and values, and show that weak institutions and cultural legacies that generate rule violations not only have direct adverse economic consequences, but might also impair individual intrinsic honesty that is crucial for the smooth functioning of society.},

	abstract = {Cooperation in joint enterprises can easily break down when self-interests are in conflict with collective benefits, causing a tragedy of the commons. In such social dilemmas, the possibility for contributors to invest in a common pool-rewards fund, which will be shared exclusively among contributors, can be powerful for averting the tragedy, as long as the second-order dilemma (i.e. withdrawing contribution to reward funds) can be overcome (e.g. with second-order sanctions). However, the present paper reveals the vulnerability of such pool-rewarding mechanisms to the presence of reward funds raised by defectors and shared among them (i.e. anti-social rewarding), as it causes a cooperation breakdown, even when second-order sanctions are possible. I demonstrate that escaping this social trap requires the additional condition that coalitions of defectors fare poorly compared with pro-socials, with either (i) better rewarding abilities for the latter or (ii) reward funds that are contingent upon the public good produced beforehand, allowing groups of contributors to invest more in reward funds than groups of defectors. These results suggest that the establishment of cooperation through a collective positive incentive mechanism is highly vulnerable to anti-social rewarding and requires additional countermeasures to act in combination with second-order sanctions.},

Theoretical and empirical studies on the importance of a punitive reputation have yielded conflicting results. Here, we propose that a variety of factors interact to explain why a punitive reputation is sometimes beneficial and sometimes harmful. We predict that benefits are most likely to occur in forced play scenarios and in situations where punishment is the only means to convey an individual's cooperative intent and willingness to uphold fairness norms. By contrast, if partner choice is possible and an individual's cooperative intent can be inferred directly, then individuals with a nonpunishing cooperative reputation should typically be preferred over punishing cooperators.},

	abstract = {The classical, ecological, paradox of enrichment describes a phenomenon that resource enrichment destabilizes predator-prey systems by exacerbating population oscillations. Here we suggest a new, evolutionary, paradox of enrichment. Resource enrichment can lead to more asymmetrical predator-prey coevolution (i.e., extremely high levels of prey defenses against predators) that decreases predator abundances and increases predator extinction risk. A major reason for this is that high resource availability can reduce fitness costs associated with prey defenses. In our experiments with a bacterium and its lytic phage, nutrient-balanced resource enrichment led to patterns in population demography and coevolutionary dynamics consistent with this coevolution-based paradox of enrichment; in particular, phage population extinction events were observed under nutrient-rich, not nutrient-poor, conditions. Consistent with ecological studies, carbon-biased resource enrichment (with carbon availability disproportionately increased relative to other nutrients) did not destabilize dynamics, and the asymmetry of coevolution was not altered in this context. Our work highlights the importance of integrating ecological and evolutionary thinking for studies of the consequences of nutrient pollution and other types of environmental changes.},

Previous theory suggests that host bottlenecks should provide parasites with an evolutionary advantage, but instead we found that phages were rapidly driven to extinction when coevolving with hosts exposed to large genetic bottlenecks. This was caused by the stochastic loss of sensitive bacteria, which are required for phage persistence and infectivity evolution. Our findings emphasize the importance of feedbacks between ecological and coevolutionary dynamics, and how this feedback can qualitatively alter coevolutionary dynamics.},

@article{jordan:Nature:2016,
	abstract = {Third-party punishment (TPP), in which unaffected observers punish selfishness, promotes cooperation by deterring defection. But why should individuals choose to bear the costs of punishing? We present a game theoretic model of TPP as a costly signal of trustworthiness. Our model is based on individual differences in the costs and/or benefits of being trustworthy. We argue that individuals for whom trustworthiness is payoff-maximizing will find TPP to be less net costly (for example, because mechanisms that incentivize some individuals to be trustworthy also create benefits for deterring selfishness via TPP). We show that because of this relationship, it can be advantageous for individuals to punish selfishness in order to signal that they are not selfish themselves. We then empirically validate our model using economic game experiments. We show that TPP is indeed a signal of trustworthiness: third-party punishers are trusted more, and actually behave in a more trustworthy way, than non-punishers. Furthermore, as predicted by our model, introducing a more informative signal--the opportunity to help directly--attenuates these signalling effects. When potential punishers have the chance to help, they are less likely to punish, and punishment is perceived as, and actually is, a weaker signal of trustworthiness. Costly helping, in contrast, is a strong and highly used signal even when TPP is also possible. Together, our model and experiments provide a formal reputational account of TPP, and demonstrate how the costs of punishing may be recouped by the long-run benefits of signalling one's trustworthiness.},

@article{cochran:EcoMon:1992,
	abstract = {Stage-classified matrix models are important analytical and theoretical tools for the study of population dynamics; in particular, these models may be appropriate for populations in which survivorship and fecundity are dependent on size or developmental stage, populations in which the age of individuals is difficult to determine, and populations in which there are multiple types of newborns. Nevertheless, methods for analyzing the implications of a population's stage-transition matrix have been limited in comparison to methods available for age-structured models (life tables or Leslie matrices). In this paper we show that all of the standard age-based measures of life history traits can be derived from a stage-transition model. By decomposing the transition matrix into separate birth, survival, and fission matrices we derive simple, direct formulas for age-based life history traits such as the discrete survivorship function, l"x, maternity function, f"x, mean age at maturity, and net reproductive rate, R"o, and also population parameters, including the stable age distribution, age-specific reproductive value, and generation time. These provide a common set of parameters for comparing age-structured and stage-structured populations or comparing populations with differently structured life cycles. In addition, we define four measures of age and life-span that summarize the relationship between stage and age in a stage-structured population: age distribution and mean age of residence for each stage class, expected remaining life-span for individuals in each stage class, and total life-span conditional on reaching a given stage class. We illustrate the use of our methods to address specific ecological questions by applying them to several previously published demographic data sets. These questions include: (1) what are the demographic effects of crowding on the tropical palm Astrocaryum mexicanum?; (2) how important is the initial rosette size in determining life history of teasel, Dipsacus sylvestris?; and (3) how old are reproducing adults in a stage-classified population of pink lady's-slipper, Cypripedium acaule? Our results may also be useful for evaluating the adequacy of a given stage-transition model.},

	abstract = { AbstractThe generation time is commonly defined as the mean age of mothers at birth. In matrix population models, a general formula is available to compute this quantity. However, it is complex and hard to interpret. Here, we present a new approach where the generation time is envisioned as a return time in an appropriate Markov chain. This yields surprisingly simple results, such as the fact that the generation time is the inverse of the sum of the elasticities of the growth rate to changes in the fertilities. This result sheds new light on the interpretation of elasticities (which as we show correspond to the frequency of events in the ancestral lineage of the population), and we use it to generalize a result known as Lebreton's formula. Finally, we also show that the generation time can be seen as a random variable, and we give a general expression for its distribution. },

	abstract = {The general nature of the predator-prey interaction has been depicted as a graph of predator versus prey densities from which conditions for stability of the interaction are predicted. An example of a three-species interaction is also presented. Variations of the graph are introduced, and it is shown that an otherwise unstable interaction may be stabilized by the presence of either an inviolable prey hiding place, or extremely low predation pressure at moderate predator and high prey densities, or another predator-limiting resource. Stability is always conferred when the predator is severely limited at its equilibrium density by one of its resources other than its supply of prey. Predators should tend to be limited at their equilibrium densities by more than one of their resources. When either of the two foregoing situations pertains, regular predator-prey oscillations should not be observable. The stability of the interaction close to equilibrium was found to depend exclusively, in the mathematically-continuous model, upon the slopes of two lines in the graph at equilibrium. Stability can be asymptotic rather than oscillatory in type. An equation for the period of oscillatory interactions is also advanced. The effects of Natural Selection on the isoclines, and thus the stability, is not clear-cut. Selection of the prey tends to stabilize the interaction; the opposite is true for selection on the predator.},

We present a simple roulette-wheel selection algorithm, which typically has O(1) complexity and is based on stochastic acceptance instead of searching. We also discuss a hybrid version, which might be suitable for highly heterogeneous weight distributions, found, for example, in some models of complex networks. With minor modifications, the algorithm might also be used for sampling with fitness cut-off at a certain value or for sampling without replacement},

@article{Kandoth:Nature:2013,
	abstract = {The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has used the latest sequencing and analysis methods to identify somatic variants across thousands of tumours. Here we present data and analytical results for point mutations and small insertions/deletions from 3,281 tumours across 12 tumour types as part of the TCGA Pan-Cancer effort. We illustrate the distributions of mutation frequencies, types and contexts across tumour types, and establish their links to tissues of origin, environmental/carcinogen influences, and DNA repair defects. Using the integrated data sets, we identified 127 significantly mutated genes from well-known (for example, mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase, Wnt/β-catenin and receptor tyrosine kinase signalling pathways, and cell cycle control) and emerging (for example, histone, histone modification, splicing, metabolism and proteolysis) cellular processes in cancer. The average number of mutations in these significantly mutated genes varies across tumour types; most tumours have two to six, indicating that the number of driver mutations required during oncogenesis is relatively small. Mutations in transcriptional factors/regulators show tissue specificity, whereas histone modifiers are often mutated across several cancer types. Clinical association analysis identifies genes having a significant effect on survival, and investigations of mutations with respect to clonal/subclonal architecture delineate their temporal orders during tumorigenesis. Taken together, these results lay the groundwork for developing new diagnostics and individualizing cancer treatment.},

Algorithms for inferring these unobserved shifts are presented, a byproduct of which permits estimation of parameters by maximum likelihood. An empirical application of this technique suggests that the periodic shift from a positive growth rate to a negative growth rate is a recurrent feature of the U.S. business cycle, and indeed could be used as an objective criterion for defining and measuring economic recessions. The estimated parameter values suggest that a typical economic recession is associated with a 3 percent permanent drop in the level of GNP. Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society.},

It shows that the economy, over time, can become locked-in, by \&quot;random\&quot; historical events, to a technological path that is not necessarily efficient, not possible to predict from usual knowledge of supply and demand functions, and not easy to change by standard tax or subsidy policies. Rational expectations about future agents' technology choices can exacerbate this lock-in tendency. It discusses the implications for economic history, policy, and forecasting.

	abstract = {This essay discusses the effect of technical change on wage inequality. I argue that the behavior of wages and returns to schooling indicates that technical change has been skill-biased during the past sixty years. Furthermore, the recent increase in inequality is most likely due to an acceleration in skill bias. In contrast to twentieth-century developments, much of the technical change during the early nineteenth century appears to be skill-replacing. I suggest that this is because the increased supply of unskilled workers in the English cities made the introduction of these technologies profitable. On the other hand, the twentieth century has been characterized by skill-biased technical change because the rapid increase in the supply of skilled workers has induced the development of skill-complementary technologies. The recent acceleration in skill bias is in turn likely to have been a response to the acceleration in the supply of skills during the past several decades.},

	abstract = {Young children have higher rates of leukemia than young adults. This fact represents a fundamental conundrum, because hematopoietic cells in young children should have fewer mutations (including oncogenic ones) than such cells in adults. Here, we present the results of stochastic modeling of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) clonal dynamics, which demonstrated that early HSC pools were permissive to clonal evolution driven by drift. We show that drift-driven clonal expansions cooperate with faster HSC cycling in young children to produce conditions that are permissive for accumulation of multiple driver mutations in a single cell. Later in life, clonal evolution was suppressed by stabilizing selection in the larger young adult pools, and it was driven by positive selection at advanced ages in the presence of microenvironmental decline. Overall, our results indicate that leukemogenesis is driven by distinct evolutionary forces in children and adults.},

	abstract = {A. The implications of experimental findings with phages on our ideas about their evolution are discussed. Four facts are emphasized as of especial importance. (1) Phages are plentiful in nature. (2) They are structurally complex. (3) Besides temperate phages, there exist in bacteria other elements capable of multiplying in either an autonomous or an integrated state (episomes). (4) Phages and other episomes can incorporate bacterial genes. B. Various possible explanations for the continued existence of bacteriophage are examined. It is concluded that: (1) Phages probably have evolved as phages rather than representing transient offshoots of some other evolutionary line; (2) Their role in bacterial recombination may be the most important factor in assuring their survival. C. The function of some of the specialized structures of phages is discussed briefly, as is the question of reproductive isolation and speciation.},

	abstract = {<title>Author Summary</title><p>Aging is a widespread phenomenon across the tree of life. From yeast to humans, mortality changes over age have been widely documented. Interestingly, all individuals are not equal with respect to the aging process: large variability in individual life span has been reported, even in clonal populations. Understanding the nature of these differences is of great interest for medical research. So far, two hypotheses have been proposed: individuals may differ in their aging rate or timing. Here, we show that these two hypotheses can reproduce experimental and empirical mortality patterns as a result of natural selection. We also predict the corresponding population heterogeneity in aging. Many studies define subpopulations ad hoc, the work we present provides insight into a more accurate description of inter-individual differences in aging. Finally, our analysis also predicts the modifications of these mortality patterns under stressful conditions. This exploration reproduces experimental data obtained with heat shocks and permits to foresee new mortality patterns that could be observed with other perturbations.</p>},

It compiles demographic systems (mortality and fertility estimates) for four broad grades of primates: New World monkeys, Old World monkeys, chimpanzees, and humans. The characteristics of each system, including its demographic stability, are presented and discussed. The environmentally induced variation in human and nonhuman primate vital rates are explored whenever possible. Findings include (a) that more data are needed particularly with respect to nonhuman primate fertility, (b) that human demographic systems are the least stable, and (c) that Pan troglodytes demography is probably evolutionarily derived from the general primate pattern.},

@article{moorad:Genetics:2008,
	abstract = {Laboratory experiments show us that the deleterious character of accumulated novel age-specific mutations is reduced and made less variable with increased age. While theories of aging predict that the frequency of deleterious mutations at mutation--selection equilibrium will increase with the mutation's age of effect, they do not account for these age-related changes in the distribution of de novo mutational effects. Furthermore, no model predicts why this dependence of mutational effects upon age exists. Because the nature of mutational distributions plays a critical role in shaping patterns of senescence, we need to develop aging theory that explains and incorporates these effects. Here we propose a model that explains the age dependency of mutational effects by extending Fisher's geometrical model of adaptation to include a temporal dimension. Using a combination of simple analytical arguments and simulations, we show that our model predicts age-specific mutational distributions that are consistent with observations from mutation-accumulation experiments. Simulations show us that these age-specific mutational effects may generate patterns of senescence at mutation--selection equilibrium that are consistent with observed demographic patterns that are otherwise difficult to explain.},

	abstract = {Analysis of mortality from a 25-yr sample of 380 Florida Scrub Jays, Aphelocoma c. coerulescens, shows that actuarial senescence (increase in mortality with age) occurs. This refutes the notion that adult mortality is independent of age in birds, and has important implications for evolutionary dynamics. We point to two major factors that may act to mask underlying patterns of actuarial senescence: (1) Selection through time (demographic heterogeneity): because selection inevitably weeds out lower quality individuals first, overall mortality may appear to be constant or even decreasing, despite an increasing force of mortality acting on birds of higher quality. (2) Conflicting processes: one source of mortality may act to decrease mortality over time (e.g., group size effects), while another acts to increase it (e.g., degenerative senescence). Age-specific data, measures of intrinsic quality that are independent of mortality, and exposure of sources of heterogeneity and of conflicting processes allow us to demonstrate a clear pattern of actuarial senescence in an unmanipulated, natural population of long-lived birds. The slow rate of increase in mortality is consistent with the hypothesis that mortality increases more slowly with age in birds than in mammals.},

	abstract = {The age-specific mortality curve for many species, including humans, is U-shaped: mortality declines with age in the developing cohort (ontogenescence) before increasing with age (senescence). The field of evolutionary demography has long focused on understanding the evolution of senescence while largely failing to address the evolution of ontogenescence. The current review is the first to gather the few available hypotheses addressing the evolution of ontogenescence, examine the basis and assumptions of each and ask what the phylogenetic extent of ontogenescence may be. Ontogenescence is among the most widespread of life-history traits, occurring in every population for which I have found sufficiently detailed data, in major groups throughout the eukaryotes, across many causes of death and many life-history types. Hypotheses seeking to explain ontogenescence include those based on kin selection, the acquisition of robustness, heterogeneous frailties and life-history optimization. I propose a further hypothesis, arguing that mortality drops with age because most transitions that could trigger the risks caused by genetic and developmental malfunctions are concentrated in early life. Of these hypotheses, only those that frame ontogenescence as an evolutionary by-product rather than an adaptation can explain the tremendous diversity of organisms and environments in which it occurs.},

This evidence of extended postreproductive survival is puzzling. Three biodemographic insights---concerning the correlation of death rates across age, individual differences in survival chances, and induced alterations in age patterns of fertility and mortality---offer clues and suggest research on the failure of complicated systems, on new demographic equations for evolutionary theory, and on fertility-longevity interactions. Nongenetic changes account for increases in human life-spans to date.

	abstract = {Demographic heterogeneity?variation among individuals in survival and reproduction?is ubiquitous in natural populations. Structured population models address heterogeneity due to age, size, or major developmental stages. However, other important sources of demographic heterogeneity, such as genetic variation, spatial heterogeneity in the environment, maternal effects, and differential exposure to stressors, are often not easily measured and hence are modeled as stochasticity. Recent research has elucidated the role of demographic heterogeneity in changing the magnitude of demographic stochasticity in small populations. Here we demonstrate a previously unrecognized effect: heterogeneous survival in long-lived species can increase the long-term growth rate in populations of any size. We illustrate this result using simple models in which each individual's annual survival rate is independent of age but survival may differ among individuals within a cohort. Similar models, but with nonoverlapping generations, have been extensively studied by demographers, who showed that, because the more ?frail? individuals are more likely to die at a young age, the average survival rate of the cohort increases with age. Within ecology and evolution, this phenomenon of ?cohort selection? is increasingly appreciated as a confounding factor in studies of senescence. We show that, when placed in a population model with overlapping generations, this heterogeneity also causes the asymptotic population growth rate ? to increase, relative to a homogeneous population with the same mean survival rate at birth. The increase occurs because, even integrating over all the cohorts in the population, the population becomes increasingly dominated by the more robust individuals. The growth rate increases monotonically with the variance in survival rates, and the effect can be substantial, easily doubling the growth rate of slow-growing populations. Correlations between parent and offspring phenotype change the magnitude of the increase in ?, but the increase occurs even for negative parent?offspring correlations. The effect of heterogeneity in reproductive rate on ? is quite different: growth rate increases with reproductive heterogeneity for positive parent?offspring correlation but decreases for negative parent?offspring correlation. These effects of demographic heterogeneity on ? have important implications for population dynamics, population viability analysis, and evolution.},

Analysis of large cohorts of ten genotypes of Drosophila melanogaster raised under conditions that favored extended survival has revealed variation between genotypes in both the slope and location of age-specific mortality curves. More detailed examination of a single genotype showed that the mortality trajectory was best fit by a two-stage Gompertz model, with no age-specific increase in mortality rates beyond 30 days after emergence. These results are contrary to the limited life-span paradigm, which postulates well-defined, genotype-specific limits on life-span and brief periods of intense and rapidly accelerating mortality rates at the oldest age.},

We do this by using a model in which the state of the organism is characterized by mass and accumulated damage, both of which are affected by activity and which affect the rate of mortality. Focusing on growth during the juvenile period, we determine the level of activity that maximizes reproductive value. Given this, we are able to project forward and determine the trajectory of mortality for an individual following the optimal life history, given the physiological and reproductive parameters. We show that there are two main classes of juvenile mortality trajectories: U-shaped (such as recently reported for prereproductive humans) and steadily declining and we are able to connect the shape of the mortality trajectory with the physiological and reproductive parameters characterizing the life history. Our work shows the importance of state in models of evolutionary biodemography and the power of modern computational methods to illuminate biological process.},

Many models linking mutation to age-specific survival have been proposed but there is little evidence to indicate which model is most appropriate. This is a serious problem because the predicted evolutionary endpoints of ageing depend upon the details of the specific model. We apply an explicitly quantitative genetic perspective to the problem. To determine the inheritance of dichotomous traits (such as survival), quantitative genetics has long employed a threshold model. Beginning from first principles, we show how this is the most defensible mutational model for age-specific survival and how this, relative to the standard model, predicts delayed senescence and mortality deceleration at late age. These are commonly observed patterns of ageing that heretofore have required more complicated survival models. We also show how this model can be developed further to unify quantitative genetics and evolutionary demography into a more complete conceptual framework for understanding the evolution of ageing.},

	abstract = {Most theoretical models for the evolution of senescence have assumed a very large, well mixed population. Here, we investigate how limited dispersal and kin competition might influence the evolution of ageing by deriving indicators of the force of selection, similar to Hamilton (Hamilton 1966 J. Theor. Biol. 12, 12‚{\"A}{\`\i}45). Our analytical model describes how the strength of selection on survival and fecundity changes with age in a patchy population, where adults are territorial and a fraction of juveniles disperse between territories. Both parent‚{\"A}{\`\i}offspring competition and sib competition then affect selection on age-specific life-history traits. Kin competition reduces the strength of selection on survival. Mutations increasing mortality in some age classes can even be favoured by selection, but only when fecundity deteriorates rapidly with age. Population structure arising from limited dispersal however selects for a broader distribution of reproduction over the lifetime, potentially slowing down reproductive senescence. The antagonistic effects of limited dispersal on age schedules of fecundity and mortality cast doubts on the generality of conditions allowing the evolution of ‚{\"A}{\`o}suicide genes‚{\"A}{\^o} that increase mortality rates without other direct pleiotropic effects. More generally, our model illustrates how limited dispersal and social interactions can indirectly produce patterns of antagonistic pleiotropy affecting vital rates at different ages.},

It is commonly applied to population growth rates calculated from linear models, but there has been no general approach to the analysis of nonlinear models. Nonlinearities in demographic models may arise due to density-dependence, frequency-dependence (in 2-sex models), feedback through the environment or the economy, and recruitment subsidy due to immigration, or from the scaling inherent in calculations of proportional population structure. This paper uses matrix calculus to derive the sensitivity and elasticity of equilibria, cycles, ratios (e.g. dependency ratios), age averages and variances, temporal averages and variances, life expectancies, and population growth rates, for both age-classified and stage-classified models. Examples are presented, applying the results to both human and non-human populations.},

@article{williams:Evolution:1957,
	abstract = {A new individual entering a population may be said to have a reproductive probability distribution. The reproductive probability is zero from zygote to reproductive maturity. Later, perhaps shortly after maturity, it reaches a peak value. Then it declines due to the cumulative probability of death. There is a cumulative probability of death with or without senescence. The selective value of a gene depends on how it affects the total reproductive probability. Selection of a gene that confers an advantage at one age and a disadvantage at another will depend not only on the magnitudes of the effects themselves, but also on the times of the effects. An advantage during the period of maximum reproductive probability would increase the total reproductive probability more than a proportionately similar disadvantage later on would decrease it. So natural selection will frequently maximize vigor in youth at the expense of vigor later on and thereby produce a declining vigor (senescence) during adult life. Selection, of course, will act to minimize the rate of this decline whenever possible. The rate of senescence shown by any species will reflect the balance between this direct, adverse selection of senescence as an unfavorable character, and the indirect, favorable selection through the age-related bias in the selection of pleiotropic genes. Variations in the amount of fecundity increase after maturity, in the adult mortality rate, and in other life-history features would affect the shape of the reproductive probability distribution and thereby influence the evolution of senescence. Any factor that decreases the rate of decline in reproductive probability intensifies selection against senescence. Any factor that increases the rate of this decline causes a relaxed selection against senescence and a greater advantage in increasing youthful vigor at the price of vigor later on. These considerations explain much of what is known of phylogenetic variation in rates of senescence. Other deductions from the theory are also supported by limited available evidence. These include the expectation that rapid morphogenesis should be associated with rapid senescence, that senescence should always be a generalized deterioration of many organs and systems, and that post-reproductive periods be short and infrequent in any wild population.},

If the vital rate measures the rate of production of one type of individual by another, then the sensitivity of growth rate is proportional to the reproductive value of the destination type and the representation in the stable stage distribution of the source type. This formal relationship exists in three forms: one limited to age-classified populations, a second that applies to stage- or age-classified populations, and a third that uses matrix calculus. Each uses a different set of formal demographic techniques; together they provide a relationship that beautifully cuts across different types of demographic models.},

	abstract = {The classic evolutionary theory of aging explains why mortality rises with age: as individuals grow older, less lifetime fertility remains, so continued survival contributes less to reproductive fitness. However, successful reproduction often involves intergenerational transfers as well as fertility. In the formal theory offered here, age-specific selective pressure on mortality depends on a weighted average of remaining fertility (the classic effect) and remaining intergenerational transfers to be made to others. For species at the optimal quantity--investment tradeoff for offspring, only the transfer effect shapes mortality, explaining postreproductive survival and why juvenile mortality declines with age. It also explains the evolution of lower fertility, longer life, and increased investments in offspring.},

	abstract = {It has been shown that differences in fecundity variance can influence the probability of invasion of a genotype in a population; i.e., a genotype with lower variance in offspring number can be favored in finite populations even if it has a somewhat lower mean fitness than a competitor. In this article, Gillespie's results are extended to population genetic systems with explicit age structure, where the demographic variance (variance in growth rate) calculated in the work of Engen and colleagues is used as a generalization of ‚{\"A}{\'u}variance in offspring number‚{\"A}{\`u} to predict the interaction between deterministic and random forces driving change in allele frequency. By calculating the variance from the life-history parameters, it is shown that selection against variance in the growth rate will favor a genotypes with lower stochasticity in age-specific survival and fertility rates. A diffusion approximation for selection and drift in a population with two genotypes with different life-history matrices (and therefore different mean growth rates and demographic variances) is derived and shown to be consistent with individual-based simulations. It is also argued that for finite populations, perturbation analyses of both the mean and the variance in growth rate may be necessary to determine the sensitivity of fitness to changes in the life-history parameters.},

Mortality rates were found to level off and decrease at older ages in a population of 1.2 million medflies maintained in cages of 7,200 and in a group of approximately 48,000 adults maintained in solitary confinement. Thus, life expectancy in older individuals increased rather than decreased with age. These results cast doubt on several central concepts in gerontology and the biology of aging: (i) that senescence can be characterized by an increase in age-specific mortality, (ii) that the basic pattern of mortality in nearly all species follows the same unitary pattern at older ages, and (iii) that species have absolute life-span limits.},

@article{moorad:PRSB:2009,
	abstract = {Quantitative genetic approaches have been developed that allow researchers to determine which of two mechanisms, mutation accumulation (MA) or antagonistic pleiotropy (AP), best explain observed variation in patterns of senescence using classical quantitative genetic techniques. These include the creation of mutation accumulation lines, artificial selection experiments and the partitioning of genetic variances across age classes. This last strategy has received the lion's share of empirical attention. Models predict that inbreeding depression (ID), dominance variance and the variance among inbred line means will all increase with age under MA but not under those forms of AP that generate marginal overdominance. Here, we show that these measures are not, in fact, diagnostic of MA versus AP. In particular, the assumptions about the value of genetic parameters in existing AP models may be rather narrow, and often violated in reality. We argue that whenever ageing-related AP loci contribute to segregating genetic variation, polymorphism at these loci will be enhanced by genetic effects that will also cause ID and dominance variance to increase with age, effects also expected under the MA model of senescence. We suggest that the tests that seek to identify the relative contributions of AP and MA to the evolution of ageing by partitioning genetic variance components are likely to be too conservative to be of general value.},

@article{chen:BioLetters:2013,
	abstract = {While ageing is commonly associated with exponential increase in mortality with age, mortality rates paradoxically decelerate late in life resulting in distinct mortality plateaus. Late-life mortality plateaus have been discovered in a broad variety of taxa, including humans, but their origin is hotly debated. One hypothesis argues that deceleration occurs because the individual probability of death stops increasing at very old ages, predicting the evolution of earlier onset of mortality plateaus under increased rate of extrinsic mortality. By contrast, heterogeneity theory suggests that mortality deceleration arises from individual differences in intrinsic lifelong robustness and predicts that variation in robustness between populations will result in differences in mortality deceleration. We used experimental evolution to directly test these predictions by independently manipulating extrinsic mortality rate (high or low) and mortality source (random death or condition-dependent) to create replicate populations of nematodes, Caenorhabditis remanei that differ in the strength of selection in late-life and in the level of lifelong robustness. Late-life mortality deceleration evolved in response to differences in mortality source when mortality rate was held constant, while there was no consistent response to differences in mortality rate. These results provide direct experimental support for the heterogeneity theory of late-life mortality deceleration.},

	abstract = {The "disposable soma" theory for the evolution of senescence suggests that senescence arises from an optimal balancing of resources between reproduction and somatic repair. Dynamic programming models are constructed and analyzed to determine the optimal relationship between reproduction, diversion of resources from repair, and added senescent mortality. Of particular interest is the relationship between the repair-reproduction trade-off and the form of the mortality-rate-versus-age curve predicted. The models analyzed in the greatest detail assume that the relationship between reproduction and added senescent mortality does not change with age. These suggest that mortality should increase at an increasing rate with age, but may approach a linear rate as mortality becomes very high. General results are derived for the shape of the mortality curves early and late in the senescing part of the life span, and mortality curves for specific trade-off functions are illustrated. An exponential increase in death rate with age (Gompertz' Law) corresponds to only one of many possible relationships between reproduction and aging. The "Law" is unlikely to hold generally if the disposable soma theory accounts for a large fraction of the observed senescent increase in mortality with age. However, support for the generality of Gompertz' Law is weak, and other theories have not produced an evolutionary explanation for the law. The disposable soma theory is consistent with some of the exceptions to Gompertz' Law that have been observed.},

Here, we invert this approach and ask, given a model of how individuals behave, how the payoff matrix will evolve through natural selection. In particular, we ask whether a prisoner&#039;s dilemma game is stable against invasions by mutant genotypes that alter the payoffs. To answer this question, we develop a two-tiered framework with goal-oriented dynamics at the behavioural time scale and a diploid population genetic model at the evolutionary time scale. Our results are two-fold: first, we show that the prisoner&#039;s dilemma is subject to invasions by mutants that provide incentives for cooperation to their partners, and that the resulting game is a coordination game similar to the hawk--dove game. Second, we find that for a large class of mutants and symmetric games, a stable genetic polymorphism will exist in the locus determining the payoff matrix, resulting in a complex pattern of behavioural diversity in the population. Our results highlight the importance of considering the evolution of payoff matrices to understand the evolution of animal social systems.},

	abstract = {The outcome of a major evolutionary transition is the aggregation of independent entities into a new synergetic level of organisation. Classical models involve either pairwise interactions between individuals or a linear superposition of these interactions. However, major evolutionary transitions display synergetic effects: their outcome is not just the sum of its parts. Multiplayer games can display such synergies, as their payoff can be different from the sum of any collection of two-player interactions. Assuming that all interactions start from pairs, how can synergetic multiplayer games emerge from simpler pairwise interaction? Here, we present a mathematical model that captures the transition from pairwise interactions to synergetic multiplayer ones. We assume that different social groups have different breaking rates. We show that non-uniform breaking rates do foster the emergence of synergy, even though individuals always interact in pairs. Our work sheds new light on the mechanisms underlying a major evolutionary transition.},

	abstract = {Typical Burkitt lymphoma is characterized by an IG-MYC translocation and overall low genomic complexity. Clinically, Burkitt lymphoma has a favourable prognosis with very few relapses. However, the few patients experiencing disease progression and/or relapse have a dismal outcome. Here we report cytogenetic findings of seven cases of Burkitt lymphoma in which sequential karyotyping was performed at time of diagnosis and/or disease progression/relapse(s). After case selection, karyotype re-review and additional molecular analyses were performed in six paediatric cases, treated in Berlin-Frankfurt-M{\"u}nster-Non-Hodgkin lymphoma study group trials, and one additional adult patient. Moreover, we analysed 18 cases of Burkitt lymphoma from the Mitelman database in which sequential karyotyping was performed. Our findings show secondary karyotypes to have a significant increase in load of cytogenetic aberrations with a mean number of 2, 5 and 8 aberrations for primary, secondary and third investigations. Importantly, this increase in karyotype complexity seemed to result from recurrent secondary chromosomal changes involving mainly trisomy 21, gains of 1q and 7q, losses of 6q, 11q, 13q, and 17p. In addition, our findings indicate a linear clonal evolution to be the predominant manner of cytogenetic evolution. Our data may provide a biological framework for the dismal outcome of progressive and relapsing Burkitt lymphoma.},

	abstract = {Predicting evolutionary paths to antibiotic resistance is key for understanding and controlling drug resistance. When considering a single final resistant genotype, epistatic contingencies among mutations restrict evolution to a small number of adaptive paths. Less attention has been given to multi-peak landscapes, and while specific peaks can be favoured, it is unknown whether and how early a commitment to final fate is made. Here we characterize a multi-peaked adaptive landscape for trimethoprim resistance by constructing all combinatorial alleles of seven resistance-conferring mutations in dihydrofolate reductase. We observe that epistatic interactions increase rather than decrease the accessibility of each peak; while they restrict the number of direct paths, they generate more indirect paths, where mutations are adaptively gained and later adaptively lost or changed. This enhanced accessibility allows evolution to proceed through many adaptive steps while delaying commitment to genotypic fate, hindering our ability to predict or control evolutionary outcomes.},

	abstract = {Two human Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines (HBL-4 and HBL-5) were established
	individually from two patients with small noncleaved cell lymphoma
	(Burkitt's type). The HBL-4 cell line is Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-negative,
	and the HBL-5 cell line is EBV-positive. Cytogenetically, both cell
	lines had the same chromosomal translocation, t(8;14)(q24;q32) as
	those observed in the primary malignant cells from individual patients.
	Morphologic, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, and molecular studies
	confirmed that both cell lines were derived from the primary lymphoma
	cells in vivo. HBL-4 cells lacked CD23(H107), CD11a(LFA-1), and latent
	membrane protein (LMP) but expressed CD54(ICAM-1) at low levels,
	whereas HBL-5 cells showed the high level of expression of CD54 and
	faint expression of LMP but lacked CD11a. In addition, the EBV-positive
	lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) expressed CD11a, CD23, CD54, and LMP
	at high levels. Therefore, an HBL-5 phenotype with expression of
	CD54 and LMP tends toward an LCL phenotype, and the augmentation
	of CD54 on the HBL-5 cells in comparison with primary lymphoma cells
	is likely to be upregulated by LMP, probably resulting from the EBV
	infection. There was little difference in the BrdUrd uptake in vivo
	and in vitro, doubling time, tumorigenicity, and dynamics of tumor
	growth in athymic nude mice between both cell lines. These findings
	indicate that the potentiality of cell growth and tumorigenicity
	of these two cell lines are unlikely to be related with EBV.},

	abstract = {Abstract An unresolved controversy regarding social behaviors is exemplified
	when natural selection might lead to behaviors that maximize fitness
	at the social-group level but are costly at the individual level.
	Except for the special case of groups of clones, we do not have a
	general understanding of how and when group-optimal behaviors evolve,
	especially when the behaviors in question are flexible. To address
	this question, we develop a general model that integrates behavioral
	plasticity in social interactions with the action of natural selection
	in structured populations. We find that group-optimal behaviors can
	evolve, even without clonal groups, if individuals exhibit appropriate
	behavioral responses to each other's actions. The evolution of such
	behavioral responses, in turn, is predicated on the nature of the
	proximate behavioral mechanisms. We model a particular class of proximate
	mechanisms, prosocial preferences, and find that such preferences
	evolve to sustain maximum group benefit under certain levels of relatedness
	and certain ecological conditions. Thus, our model demonstrates the
	fundamental interplay between behavioral responses and relatedness
	in determining the course of social evolution. We also highlight
	the crucial role of proximate mechanisms such as prosocial preferences
	in the evolution of behavioral responses and in facilitating evolutionary
	transitions in individuality.},

	of the biological processes generating these mutations is limited.
	The catalogue of somatic mutations from a cancer genome bears the
	signatures of the mutational processes that have been operative.
	Here we analysed 4,938,362 mutations from 7,042 cancers and extracted
	more than 20 distinct mutational signatures. Some are present in
	many cancer types, notably a signature attributed to the APOBEC family
	of cytidine deaminases, whereas others are confined to a single cancer
	class. Certain signatures are associated with age of the patient
	at cancer diagnosis, known mutagenic exposures or defects in DNA
	maintenance, but many are of cryptic origin. In addition to these
	genome-wide mutational signatures, hypermutation localized to small
	genomic regions, 'kataegis', is found in many cancer types. The results
	reveal the diversity of mutational processes underlying the development
	of cancer, with potential implications for understanding of cancer
	aetiology, prevention and therapy.},

	abstract = {Abstract Evolutionary dynamics depend critically on a population's
	interaction structure---the pattern of which individuals interact
	with which others, depending on the state of the population and the
	environment. Previous research has shown, for example, that cooperative
	behaviors disfavored in well-mixed populations can be favored when
	interactions occur only between spatial neighbors or group members.
	Combining the adaptive dynamics approach with recent advances in
	evolutionary game theory, we here introduce a general mathematical
	framework for analyzing the long-term evolution of continuous game
	strategies for a broad class of evolutionary models, encompassing
	many varieties of interaction structure. Our main result, the canonical
	equation of adaptive dynamics with interaction structure, characterizes
	expected evolutionary trajectories resulting from any such model,
	thereby generalizing a central tool of adaptive dynamics theory.
	Interestingly, the effects of different interaction structures and
	update rules on evolutionary trajectories are fully captured by just
	two real numbers associated with each model, which are independent
	of the considered game. The first, a structure coefficient, quantifies
	the effects on selection pressures and thus on the shapes of expected
	evolutionary trajectories. The second, an effective population size,
	quantifies the effects on selection responses and thus on the expected
	rates of adaptation. Applying our results to two social dilemmas,
	we show how the range of evolutionarily stable cooperative behaviors
	systematically varies with a model's structure coefficient.},

	The observation that infectious diseases might be both mitigated

	gives new significance to the role of host genetic diversity in species
	conservation. Less clear is the role that pathogen evolutionary change
	plays in the emergence and spread of new diseases, but recent examples
	indicate that humans might be selecting unknowingly for rapid changes
	in pathogen biology through habitat fragmentation, climate shifts
	and environmental pollution. Although the risks they pose to endangered
	species are apparent, pathogens and other natural enemies can be
	a driving force behind species and genetic diversity in natural populations,
	and preserving interacting networks of coevolving populations should
	enable hosts to respond better to future disease threats.},

	dilemma, where the public good is a linear function of the individual
	contributions, cooperation requires some form of assortment, for
	example due to kin discrimination, population viscosity or repeated
	interactions. In most social species ranging from bacteria to humans,
	however, public goods are usually a non-linear function of the contributions,
	which makes cooperation possible without assortment. More specifically,
	a polymorphic state can be stable in which cooperators and non-cooperators
	coexist. The existence of mixed equilibria in public goods games
	is a fundamental result in the study of cooperation that has been
	overlooked so far, because of the disproportionate attention given
	to the two- and N-person prisoner's dilemma. Methods and results
	from games with pairwise interactions or linear benefits cannot,
	in general, be extended to the analysis of public goods. Game theory
	helps explain the production of public goods in one-shot, N-person
	interactions without assortment, it leads to predictions that can
	be easily tested and allows a prescriptive approach to cooperation.},

	abstract = {Evolution is a dynamic process. The two classical forces of evolution
	are mutation and selection. Assuming small mutation rates, evolution
	can be predicted based solely on the fitness differences between
	phenotypes. Predicting an evolutionary process under varying mutation
	rates as well as varying fitness is still an open question. Experimental
	procedures, however, do include these complexities along with fluctuating
	population sizes and stochastic events such as extinctions. We investigate
	the mutational path probabilities of systems having epistatic effects
	on both fitness and mutation rates using a theoretical and computational
	framework. In contrast to previous models, we do not limit ourselves
	to the typical strong selection, weak mutation (SSWM)-regime or to
	fixed population sizes. Rather we allow epistatic interactions to
	also affect mutation rates. This can lead to qualitatively non-trivial
	dynamics. Pathways, that are negligible in the SSWM-regime, can overcome
	fitness valleys and become accessible. This finding has the potential
	to extend the traditional predictions based on the SSWM foundation
	and bring us closer to what is observed in experimental systems.},

@article{bauer:JTB:2014,
	abstract = {We investigate the dynamics of cancer initiation in a mathematical
	model with one driver mutation and several passenger mutations. Our
	analysis is based on a multi-type branching process: we model individual
	cells which can either divide or undergo apoptosis. In the case of
	a cell division, the two daughter cells can mutate, which potentially
	confers a change in fitness to the cell. In contrast to previous
	models, the change in fitness induced by the driver mutation depends
	on the genetic context of the cell, in our case on the number of
	passenger mutations. The passenger mutations themselves have no or
	only a very small impact on the cell׳s fitness. While our model
	is not designed as a specific model for a particular cancer, the
	underlying idea is motivated by clinical and experimental observations
	in Burkitt Lymphoma. In this tumor, the hallmark mutation leads to
	deregulation of the MYC oncogene which increases the rate of apoptosis,
	but also the proliferation rate of cells. This increase in the rate
	of apoptosis hence needs to be overcome by mutations affecting apoptotic
	pathways, naturally leading to an epistatic fitness landscape. This
	model shows a very interesting dynamical behavior which is distinct
	from the dynamics of cancer initiation in the absence of epistasis.
	Since the driver mutation is deleterious to a cell with only a few
	passenger mutations, there is a period of stasis in the number of
	cells until a clone of cells with enough passenger mutations emerges.
	Only when the driver mutation occurs in one of those cells, the cell
	population starts to grow rapidly.},

	whether populations can be rescued by evolution depends upon several
	crucial variables: population size, the supply of genetic variation,
	and the degree of maladaptation to the new environment. Using techniques
	in experimental evolution we tested the conditions for evolutionary
	rescue ({ER}). Hundreds of yeast populations were exposed to normally
	lethal concentrations of salt in conditions, where the frequency
	of rescue mutations was estimated and population size was manipulated.
	In a striking match with theory, we show that {ER} is possible, and
	that the recovery of the population may occur within 25 generations.
	We observed a clear threshold in population size for {ER} whereby
	the ancestral population size must be sufficiently large to counter
	stochastic extinction and contain resistant individuals. These results
	demonstrate that rapid evolution is an important component of the
	response of small populations to environmental change.},

One has thus the problem of the explicit computation of such exponents, which has been solved only for the maximal of them. Here we give a method for computing all of them, based on the computation of the exponents of order greater than one, which are related to the increase of volumes. To this end a theorem is given relating the exponents of order one to those of greater order. The numerical method and some applications will be given in a forthcoming paper.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: All living organisms are made of individual and identifiable
	cells, whose number, together with their size and type, ultimately
	defines the structure and functions of an organism. While the total
	cell number of lower organisms is often known, it has not yet been
	defined in higher organisms. In particular, the reported total cell
	number of a human being ranges between 10(12) and 10(16) and it is
	widely mentioned without a proper reference. AIM: To study and discuss
	the theoretical issue of the total number of cells that compose the
	standard human adult organism. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A systematic
	calculation of the total cell number of the whole human body and
	of the single organs was carried out using bibliographical and/or
	mathematical approaches. RESULTS: A current estimation of human total
	cell number calculated for a variety of organs and cell types is
	presented. These partial data correspond to a total number of 3.72 × 10(13).
	CONCLUSIONS: Knowing the total cell number of the human body as well
	as of individual organs is important from a cultural, biological,
	medical and comparative modelling point of view. The presented cell
	count could be a starting point for a common effort to complete the
	total calculation.},

	abstract = {The Li-Fraumeni cancer predisposition syndrome is associated with
	germline TP53 mutations in the majority of families. We have investigated
	cancer incidence in 34 Li-Fraumeni families, according to their constitutional
	TP53 mutation status. Families with germline missense mutations in
	the core DNA binding domain showed a more highly penetrant cancer
	phenotype than families with other TP53 mutations or no mutation.
	Cancer phenotype in families carrying such mutations was characterized
	by a higher cancer incidence and earlier ages at diagnosis, especially
	of breast cancer and brain tumours, compared with families carrying
	protein truncating or other inactivating mutations (P=0.03 for all
	cancers, P=0.006 for breast cancers, P=0.05 for brain tumours). Proband
	cancers showed significantly younger ages at diagnosis in those with
	missense mutations in the DNA binding domain than in those with protein
	inactivating mutations (P=0.031). In individuals with the former
	type of mutation, there was a significantly lower proportion of tumours
	which showed loss of the wild-type TP53 allele (P=0.004). These results
	are consistent with observations in experimental systems which demonstrate
	that certain mutations exhibit gain of function and/or dominant-negative
	properties. Our results support an enhanced oncogenic potential for
	such mutations in human populations.},

	abstract = {Although Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) is classified as one entity in the
	World Health Organisation (WHO) classification, we wondered whether
	BL should not be considered as a different disease in children compared
	with adults. Netherlands Cancer Registry (NCR) data were obtained
	from 1994 to 1998 (n=203). Detailed clinical data from two treatment
	protocols were compared: one for adults up to the age of 65 years
	(n=27) and one for children (n=80). All slides of the two clinical
	studies were centrally reviewed which included immunophenotyping
	and when necessary breakpoint analysis of MYC/8q24. Only cases with
	an unambiguous diagnosis of BL (classical and atypical BL) were accepted.
	The age distribution of BL-patients showed a bimodal distribution
	with a peak at the paediatric age and a steady increase after approximately
	60 years of age. Most of the patients were males (89% for children
	and 78% for adults) and only male patients showed this bimodality.
	Children more often had extranodal disease (81% vs. 59%), whereas
	adults more often had nodal disease (89% vs. 53%). Based on epidemiology
	and clinical presentation, the concept that BL is one disease should
	be re-challenged.},

@article{boerma:Leukemia:2009,
	abstract = {Burkitt lymphoma (BL) has a characteristic clinical presentation,
	morphology, immunophenotype and primary chromosomal aberration, that
	is, the translocation t(8;14)(q24;q32) or its variants. However,
	diagnostic dilemmas may arise in daily practice due to overlap of
	BL with subsets of other aggressive, mature B-cell lymphomas such
	as diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL). Recently, two gene expression
	studies have described a distinct molecular profile for BL, but also
	showed the persistence of some cases intermediate between BL and
	DLBCL. An alternative approach to define BL is to consider (cyto)genetic
	data, in particular chromosomal abnormalities other than the t(8;14)
	or its variants. In this review the 'Mitelman Database of Chromosome
	Aberrations in Cancer,' harboring the majority of all published neoplasia-related
	karyotypes, was explored to define a cytogenetic profile of 'true'
	BL. This core subset of BL showed a very low complexity of chromosomal
	abnormalities with 40% of the cases having the IG-MYC fusion as the
	sole abnormality. In the remaining cases, additional recurrent but
	partially exclusive abnormalities included gains at chromosomes 1q,
	7 and 12, and losses of 6q, 13q32-34 and 17p. Within the core subset,
	no differences were found between pediatric and adult patients. In
	addition, the genetic profile of the core subset was significantly
	different from BL with an 8q24 breakpoint not affecting one of the
	three immunoglobulin loci, BL with a translocation involving 18q21/BCL2,
	3q27/BCL6 or 11q13/BCL1, additionally to a breakpoint at 8q24/MYC,
	and from other morphological types of lymphomas with an 8q24/MYC
	breakpoint. These groups showed a higher cytogenetic complexity than
	the core subset of BL. BL without a detectable 8q24/MYC breakpoint
	might be heterogeneous and deserves further studies. We suggest that,
	concordant with the WHO classification to be published in 2008, the
	diagnosis of BL should be restricted to cases with expression of
	CD10 and BCL6, absence or very weak expression of BCL2 protein, a
	homogeneously very high proliferation index and a proven IG-MYC translocation
	without evidence of a chromosomal translocation typical for other
	lymphoma entities. In addition, a high number of nonspecific cytogenetic
	abnormalities should suggest need for a critical review of the diagnosis
	of BL.},

	Willamowski-R{\"o}ssler system. Analytical results are confirmed

	and group behavior in the laboratory. Depending on the game's payoff
	structure, contradictions or conflicts are created among the rational
	choices at the individual, group, and collective levels---a generalization
	of the contradiction between individual and collective rationality
	occurring in the traditional mixed-motive games. These contradictions

	on each team was compared to a two-person chicken game and a (single-group)
	four-person chicken game. The games were played repeatedly, and each

	I ask a more precise question: If more cooperative groups were more
	likely to prevail in conflicts with other groups, was the level of
	intergroup violence sufficient to influence the evolution of human
	social behavior? Using a model of the evolutionary impact of between-group
	competition and a new data set that combines archaeological evidence
	on causes of death during the Late Pleistocene and early Holocene
	with ethnographic and historical reports on hunter-gatherer populations,
	I find that the estimated level of mortality in intergroup conflicts

	abstract = { We review current ideas about coevolution of plants and parasites,
	particularly processes that generate genetic diversity. Frequencies
	of host resistance and parasite virulence alleles that interact in
	gene-for-gene (GFG) relationships coevolve in the familiar boom-and-bust
	cycle, in which resistance is selected when virulence is rare, and
	virulence is selected when resistance is common. The cycle can result
	in stable polymorphism when diverse ecological and epidemiological
	factors cause negative direct frequency-dependent selection (ndFDS)
	on host resistance, parasite virulence, or both, such that the benefit
	of a trait to fitness declines as its frequency increases. Polymorphism
	can also be stabilized by overdominance, when heterozygous hosts
	have greater resistance than homozygotes to diverse pathogens. Genetic
	diversity can also persist in the form of statistical polymorphism,
	sustained by random processes acting on gene frequencies and population
	size. Stable polymorphism allows alleles to be long-lived and genetic
	variation to be detectable in natural populations. In agriculture,
	many of the factors promoting stability in host-parasite interactions
	have been lost, leading to arms races of host defenses and parasite
	effectors. },

@article{busch:HAE:2004,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The translocation t(8;14)(q24;q32), involving
	the c-myc gene (8q24) and the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) locus
	(14q32), represents about 75% of all chromosomal translocations in
	Burkitt's lymphoma (BL). Due to the large variability of the breakpoint
	region, only the recently improved long-distance LD-polymerase chain
	reaction (PCR) allows the specific c-myc/IgH fusion to be identified
	at the genomic level. The sensitivity of the LD-PCR is only 10(-2)
	to 10(-3) due to the relatively large size of the amplification products
	(1 to 10 kbp). We, therefore, established a more sensitive nested
	PCR with a specific primer combination for each patient based on
	sequence analysis of the variant breakpoint regions. DESIGN AND METHODS:
	Using the combined PCR methods, we analyzed bone marrow and peripheral
	blood without visible blasts at diagnosis from 18 patients with t(8;14)-positive
	BL. RESULTS: In tests employing dilutions of genomic DNA from the
	BL cell line CA-46 in the T-cell lymphoma cell line KARPAS-299, which
	lacks the t(8;14), the sensitivity increased 100-fold, to 10(-5).
	However, the investigation of 18 c-myc/IgH-positive BL patients with
	each breakpoint-specific nested PCR showed an inter-patient variability
	of sensitivity between 10(-3) and 10(-5). Using this assay, the rearrangement
	was detected in 4/16 bone marrow samples and in 6/15 peripheral blood
	samples without visible blasts at diagnosis. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS:
	Using the combined PCR methods the detection of c-myc/IgH reaches
	a level of sensitivity required for the evaluation of minimal residual
	disease (MRD) in BL patients. Furthermore, the results highlight
	the importance of verifying the patient-specific sensitivity level
	for individual MRD monitoring.},

	parochialism---hostility toward individuals not of one's own ethnic,
	racial, or other group---are common human behaviors. The intersection
	of the two---which we term ``parochial altruism''---is puzzling from
	an evolutionary perspective because altruistic or parochial behavior
	reduces one's payoffs by comparison to what one would gain by eschewing
	these behaviors. But parochial altruism could have evolved if parochialism
	promoted intergroup hostilities and the combination of altruism and
	parochialism contributed to success in these conflicts. Our game-theoretic
	analysis and agent-based simulations show that under conditions likely
	to have been experienced by late Pleistocene and early Holocene humans,
	neither parochialism nor altruism would have been viable singly,
	but by promoting group conflict, they could have evolved jointly.},

	abstract = {The Red Queen Hypothesis (RQH) explains how pathogens may maintain
	sexual reproduction in hosts. It assumes that parasites become specialized
	on common host genotypes, reducing their fitness. Such frequency-dependent
	selection favors sexual reproduction in host populations. Necessary
	conditions are that resistance and virulence are genotype specific
	so that host genotype frequencies respond to changes in pathogen
	genotype frequencies, and vice versa. Empirical evidence on the genetic
	basis of disease, variation in resistance and virulence, and patterns
	of infection in sexual and asexual plants support certain features
	of the hypothesis. However, gene-for-gene interactions are generally
	not consistent with the RQH because they do not result in cycling
	of gene frequencies, unlike a matching allele mechanism. A conclusion
	of whether the RQH can explain the maintenance of sexual reproduction
	cannot be reached at present. Nevertheless, the RQH theory has shed
	light on many aspects of plant/pathogen interactions important for
	reducing pathogen damage in agricultural systems. },

	abstract = {A general model which accommodates different fitness values of an
	individual in association with each other type of individual is studied.
	The model in conjunction with population composition, in which individuals
	are assumed to be dispersed at random, determines the relative fitness
	values of individuals. Expressions for the change in gene frequency
	and for the mean are derived for one locus with two alleles in a
	random mating population. Equilibrium and max/min mean compositions
	generally require solving third-degree equations, but explicit expressions
	are found for models with general levels of dominance and some of
	their variants. Protected polymorphisms, genetic loads, inbreeding
	depressions, and the cost of a gene substitution are also considered.
	Many additional features of the statics and dynamics of populations
	are introduced with the effects of population composition on fitnesses.
	A single globally stable equilibrium can exist without any dominance.
	There may be multiple equilibria, up to three, with various stability
	characteristics, some of which are protected polymorphisms. There
	need not be any correspondence between compositions for max/min means
	and those for equilibria. Inbreeding depressions may be curvilinear,
	and even stable equilibrium populations may show negative inbreeding
	depressions. Very different models may give the same genetic load.
	The number of genetic deaths required for a gene substitution may
	be as few as twice the population size. One appeal of the model is
	that it encompasses several classes of models, including those with
	constant fitness values, and thus provides a basis for determining
	the appropriate model. After considering alternative experiments
	and measures of discrimination, we conclude that only survival values
	of the genotypes for several population compositions would be sufficient
	to discriminate between certain models.},

	abstract = {Abstract Non-Darwinian theories about the emergence and evolution
	of complexity date back at least to Lamarck, and include those of
	Herbert Spencer and the ``emergent evolution'' theorists of the later
	nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In recent decades, this
	approach has mostly been espoused by various practitioners in biophysics
	and complexity theory. However, there is a Darwinian alternative
	-- in essence, an economic theory of complexity -- proposing that
	synergistic effects of various kinds have played an important causal
	role in the evolution of complexity, especially in the ``major transitions''.
	This theory is called the ``synergism hypothesis''. We posit that
	otherwise unattainable functional advantages arising from various
	cooperative phenomena have been favored over time in a dynamic that
	the late John Maynard Smith characterized and modeled as ``synergistic
	selection''. The term highlights the fact that synergistic ``wholes''
	may become interdependent ``units'' of selection. We provide some
	historical perspective on this issue, as well as a brief explication
	of the underlying theory and the concept of synergistic selection,
	and we describe two relevant models.},

	abstract = {Cooperativeness is a defining feature of human nature. Theoreticians
	have suggested several mechanisms to explain this ubiquitous phenomenon,
	including reciprocity, reputation, and punishment, but the problem
	is still unsolved. Here we show, through experiments conducted with
	groups of people playing an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma on a dynamic
	network, that it is reputation what really fosters cooperation. While
	this mechanism has already been observed in unstructured populations,
	we find that it acts equally when interactions are given by a network
	that players can reconfigure dynamically. Furthermore, our observations
	reveal that memory also drives the network formation process, and
	cooperators assort more, with longer link lifetimes, the longer the
	past actions record. Our analysis demonstrates, for the first time,
	that reputation can be very well quantified as a weighted mean of
	the fractions of past cooperative acts and the last action performed.
	This finding has potential applications in collaborative systems
	and e-commerce.},

	with an intra-group cooperation dilemma and inter-group competition.
	In our design subjects receive information about their relative individual
	and group performance after each round with non-incentivized and
	then incentivized group competition. We found that, on average, individuals
	with low relative performance reduce their contributions to the public
	good, but groups with low performance increase theirs. With incentivized
	competition, where the relative ranking of the group increases individual
	payoffs, the reaction to relative performance is larger with individuals
	contributing more to the group; further, we observe that the variance
	of strategies decreases as individual and group rankings increase.
	These results offer new insights on how social comparison shapes
	similar reactions in games with different incentives for group performance
	and how competition and cooperation can influence each other.},

@article{dang:SCB:2006,
	abstract = {For more than a decade, numerous studies have suggested that the c-Myc
	oncogenic protein is likely to broadly influence the composition
	of the transcriptome. However, the evidence required to support this
	notion was made available only recently, much to the anticipation
	of an eagerly awaiting field. In the past 5 years, many high-throughput
	screens based on microarray gene expression profiling, serial analysis
	of gene expression (SAGE), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed
	by genomic array analysis, and Myc-methylase chimeric proteins have
	generated a wealth of information regarding Myc responsive and target
	genes. From these studies, the c-Myc target gene network is estimated
	to comprise about 15% of all genes from flies to humans. Both genomic
	and functional analyses of c-Myc targets suggest that while c-Myc
	behaves as a global regulator of transcription, groups of genes involved
	in cell cycle regulation, metabolism, ribosome biogenesis, protein
	synthesis, and mitochondrial function are over-represented in the
	c-Myc target gene network. c-Myc also consistently represses genes
	involved in cell growth arrest and cell adhesion. The overexpression
	of c-Myc predisposes cells to apoptosis under nutrient or growth
	factor deprivation conditions, although the critical sets of genes
	involved remain elusive. Despite tremendous advances, the downstream
	target genes that distinguish between physiologic and tumorigenic
	functions of c-Myc remain to be delineated.},

@article{dave:NEJM:2006,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The distinction between Burkitt's lymphoma and diffuse
	large-B-cell lymphoma is crucial because these two types of lymphoma
	require different treatments. We examined whether gene-expression
	profiling could reliably distinguish Burkitt's lymphoma from diffuse
	large-B-cell lymphoma. METHODS: Tumor-biopsy specimens from 303 patients
	with aggressive lymphomas were profiled for gene expression and were
	also classified according to morphology, immunohistochemistry, and
	detection of the t(8;14) c-myc translocation. RESULTS: A classifier
	based on gene expression correctly identified all 25 pathologically
	verified cases of classic Burkitt's lymphoma. Burkitt's lymphoma
	was readily distinguished from diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma by the
	high level of expression of c-myc target genes, the expression of
	a subgroup of germinal-center B-cell genes, and the low level of
	expression of major-histocompatibility-complex class I genes and
	nuclear factor-kappaB target genes. Eight specimens with a pathological
	diagnosis of diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma had the typical gene-expression
	profile of Burkitt's lymphoma, suggesting they represent cases of
	Burkitt's lymphoma that are difficult to diagnose by current methods.
	Among 28 of the patients with a molecular diagnosis of Burkitt's
	lymphoma, the overall survival was superior among those who had received
	intensive chemotherapy regimens instead of lower-dose regimens. CONCLUSIONS:
	Gene-expression profiling is an accurate, quantitative method for
	distinguishing Burkitt's lymphoma from diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma.},

	abstract = {Most human tumors result from the accumulation of multiple genetic
	and epigenetic alterations in a single cell. Mutations that confer
	a fitness advantage to the cell are known as driver mutations and
	are causally related to tumorigenesis. Other mutations, however,
	do not change the phenotype of the cell or even decrease cellular
	fitness. While much experimental effort is being devoted to the identification
	of the functional effects of individual mutations, mathematical modeling
	of tumor progression generally considers constant fitness increments
	as mutations are accumulated. In this paper we study a mathematical
	model of tumor progression with random fitness increments. We analyze
	a multi-type branching process in which cells accumulate mutations
	whose fitness effects are chosen from a distribution. We determine
	the effect of the fitness distribution on the growth kinetics of
	the tumor. This work contributes to a quantitative understanding
	of the accumulation of mutations leading to cancer.},

	abstract = {Understanding the evolution of social behaviours such as altruism
	and spite is a long-standing problem that has generated thousands
	of articles and heated debates. Previous theoretical studies showed
	that whether altruism and spite evolve may be contingent on seemingly
	artificial model features, such as which rule is chosen to update
	the population (for example, birth--death or death--birth), and whether
	the benefits and costs of sociality affect fecundity or survival.
	Here we unify these features in a single comprehensive framework.
	We derive a general condition for social behaviour to be favoured
	over non-social behaviour, which is applicable in a large class of
	models for structured populations of fixed size. We recover previous
	results as special cases, and we are able to evaluate the relative
	effects of benefits and costs of social interactions on fecundity
	and survival. Our results highlight the crucial importance of identifying
	the relative scale at which competition occurs.},

	abstract = { Abstract: It has been suggested that the harm parasites cause to their hosts is an unavoidable consequence of parasite reproduction with costs not only for the host but also for the parasite. Castrating parasites are thought to minimize their costs by reducing host fecundity, which may minimize the chances of killing both host and parasite prematurely. We conducted a series of experiments to understand the evolution of virulence of a castrating bacterium in the planktonic crustacean Daphnia magna. By manipulating food levels during the infection of D. magna with the bacterium Pasteuria ramosa, we showed that both antagonists are resource‐limited and that a negative correlation between host and parasite reproduction exists, indicating resource competition among the antagonists. Pasteuria ramosa also induces enhanced growth of its hosts (gigantism), which we found to be negatively correlated with host fecundity but positively correlated with parasite reproduction. Because infected hosts never recovered from infections, we concluded that gigantism is beneficial only for the parasite. Hosts, however, have evolved counteradaptations. We showed that infected hosts have enhanced reproduction before castration. This shift to earlier reproduction increases overall host fecundity and compromises parasite reproduction. Finally, we showed that this resource conflict is subject to genetic variation among host and parasite genotypes within a population and is therefore likely to be an important force in the coevolution of virulence in this system. A verbal model is presented and suggests that the adaptive value of gigantism is to store host resources, which are liberated after parasitic castration for later use by the growing parasite. This hypothesis assumes that infections are long lasting, that is, that they have a high life expectancy. },

	abstract = {Deregulated oncogenes such as MYC and RAS are typically insufficient
	to transform cells on their own due to the activation of pathways
	that restrain proliferation. Previous studies have shown that oncogenic
	H-Ras can induce proliferative arrest or senescence, depending on
	the cellular context. Here, we show that deregulated H-Ras activity
	can also lead to caspase-independent cell death with features of
	autophagy. Ras-induced autophagy was associated with upregulation
	of the BH3-only protein Noxa as well as the autophagy regulator Beclin-1.
	Silencing of Noxa or Beclin-1 expression reduced Ras-induced autophagy
	and increased clonogenic survival. Ras-induced cell death was also
	inhibited by coexpression of Bcl-2 family members that inhibit Beclin-1
	function. Ras-induced autophagy was associated with Noxa-mediated
	displacement of the Bcl-2 family member, Mcl-1, from Beclin-1. Thus,
	Ras-induced expression of Noxa and Beclin-1 promotes autophagic cell
	death, which represents a mechanism to limit the oncogenic potential
	of deregulated Ras signals.},

	abstract = {We analyse metapopulation dynamics in terms of an individual-based,
	stochastic model of a finite metapopulation. We suggest a new approach,
	using the number of patches in the population as a large parameter.
	This approach does not require that the number of individuals per
	patch is large, neither is it necessary to assume a time-scale separation
	between local population dynamics and migration. Our approach makes
	it possible to accurately describe the dynamics of metapopulations
	consisting of many small patches. We focus on metapopulations on
	the brink of extinction. We estimate the time to extinction and describe
	the most likely path to extinction. We find that the logarithm of
	the time to extinction is proportional to the product of two vectors,
	a vector characterising the distribution of patch population sizes
	in the quasi-steady state, and a vector-related to Fisher's reproduction
	vector-that quantifies the sensitivity of the quasi-steady state
	distribution to demographic fluctuations. We compare our analytical
	results to stochastic simulations of the model, and discuss the range
	of validity of the analytical expressions. By identifying fast and
	slow degrees of freedom in the metapopulation dynamics, we show that
	the dynamics of large metapopulations close to extinction is approximately
	described by a deterministic equation originally proposed by Levins
	(1969). We were able to compute the rates in Levins' equation in
	terms of the parameters of our stochastic, individual-based model.
	It turns out, however, that the interpretation of the dynamical variable
	depends strongly on the intrinsic growth rate and carrying capacity
	of the patches. Only when the local growth rate and the carrying
	capacity are large does the slow variable correspond to the number
	of patches, as envisaged by Levins. Last but not least, we discuss
	how our findings relate to other, widely used metapopulation models.},

@article{frank:PRSB:1993,
	abstract = {Detectable polymorphism of host resistance and parasite host range
	is a poor guide to the specificity of a host--parasite interaction.
	I analyse a simple haploid model to support this claim. The model
	assumes that the true specificity is `matching-allele', in which
	each of n host alleles causes resistance to only one of n different
	parasite alleles. The detectable polymorphism in samples from a matching-allele
	system would lead one to infer the gene-for-gene specificity commonly
	observed in plant-pathogen interactions. Gene-for-gene and matching-allele
	specificity require very different fitness assumptions to explain
	observed patterns of polymorphism. Yet models for each type of specificity
	can easily be constructed that fit the available data. In addition,
	the currently favoured `elicitor-receptor' model for the biochemistry
	of plant-pathogen recognition agrees equally well with gene-for-gene
	or matching-allele specificity. I do not claim that the simple matching-allele
	specificity is the correct model for plant--pathogen genetics. My
	point is that one cannot reconstruct both specificity and population
	history from patterns of resistance among host--parasite pairs in
	a sample. I draw two conclusions: first, inferred specificity and
	polymorphism are only useful when compared with a family of theoretical
	models; and secondly, biochemical models of specificity must be tested
	by their population genetic consequences.},

	to be significantly more adapted to their local host populations
	than to hosts from distant populations. We developed a metapopulation
	model, taking explicit account of both population densities and gene
	frequencies, to determine the influence of ecological and genetical
	parameters on the local adaptation of the parasites and on the spatial
	distribution of resistance and virulence genes. Our results point
	to the predominant effect of ecological parameters such as parasite
	growth rate and host and parasite migration rates on coevolutionary
	outcomes. In particular, the parasites are more likely to be adapted
	to their local host population than to allopatric hosts when the
	parasite migration rate is larger than the host migration rate. The
	opposite should be observed whenever hosts migrate more than parasites.},

	abstract = {Understanding host range evolution in plant viruses is central for
	the control of viral diseases: changes in host range resulting in
	host switches or host range expansions are at the root of virus emergence
	either in new host species or in host genotypes previously resistant
	to the virus. Theory predicts that different selection pressures
	in different hosts will result in fitness trade-offs across hosts,
	leading to specialization. This paper reviews the evidence in support
	of this prediction. A large fraction of plant viruses are multihost
	parasites: evidence for across-species trade-offs has been reported
	both from the analysis of field virus populations and, more often,
	from passage experiments resulting in host adaptation. More abundant
	evidence for across-host trade-offs derives from the analysis of
	the performance of resistance-breaking virus genotypes in resistant
	and susceptible host genotypes. Data indicate that overcoming dominant
	resistance is coupled to severe fitness costs, while overcoming recessive
	resistance may be associated with fitness costs according to the
	specific virus genotype. There is ample evidence that antagonistic
	pleiotropy is a major cause of the reported across-host trade-offs.},

	abstract = {A series of experiments is described in which fragments derived from
	two mammary tumors
	of distinct types were transferred at different developmental stages
	to the anterior chamber of the eye of normal rabbits. It was found
	that the ability to survive and to grow progressively after transplantation
	was not immediately related to anaplastic cellular changes. On the
	other hand, there existed a definite correlation between the success
	of transplantation and the morphological relationship of tumor cells
	and the normal cells of the host. Transplantation to normal animals
	could not be effected during stages of local tissue invasion but
	was successfully performed as soon as the tumor cells manifested
	the ability to invade foreign tissues or to metastasize in the spontaneous
	host. It was concluded, therefore, that neither anaplasia nor local
	tissue invasion represented autonomy but, rather, stages in its development
	and that the final attainment of this condition was only evidenced
	by metastasis or by invasion in foreign tissues. The tumors were
	successfully transplanted to normal animals during this series of
	experiments and have been carried by serial transfer to the present
	time. The most outstanding feature in the transplantation of the
	papillary type tumor was the marked difference in susceptibility
	exhibited by the two sexes. The acinar type tumor was distinguished
	by high transplantability, an extremely rapid growth rate and early
	regression.},

	abstract = {Economists and psychologists have been testing Nash equilibrium predictions
	of game theory models of human behavior. In many instances, humans
	do not conform to the predictions. These results are of great interest
	to biologists because they also raise questions about well-known
	ESS models of cooperation. Cooperation in certain one-shot, anonymous
	interactions, and a willingness to punish others at a net cost to
	oneself are some of the most intriguing deviations from standard
	theory. One proposed explanation for these results that is receiving
	increasing attention invokes the cultural group selection of `other
	regarding' social norms. We critically review this explanation. We
	conclude that experimental results reveal limits in two implicit
	models of cognitive structure commonly employed by economists and
	evolutionary biologists.},

	abstract = {<p>The prevalent way aphids accomplish colony defense against natural
	enemies is a mutualistic relationship with ants or the occurrence
	of a specialised soldier caste typcial for eusocial aphids, or even
	both. Despite a group-living life style of those aphid species lacking
	these defense lines, communal defense against natural predators has
	not yet been observed there. Individuals of <italic>Aphis nerii</italic>
	(Oleander aphid) and <italic>Uroleucon hypochoeridis</italic>, an
	aphid species feeding on <italic>Hypochoeris radicata</italic> (hairy
	cat's ear), show a behavioral response to visual stimulation in the
	form of spinning or twitching, which is often accompanied by coordinated
	kicks executed with hind legs. Interestingly, this behaviour is highly
	synchronized among members of a colony and repetitive visual stimulation
	caused strong habituation. Observations of natural aphid colonies
	revealed that a collective twitching and kicking response (CTKR)
	was frequently evoked during oviposition attempts of the parasitoid
	wasp <italic>Aphidius colemani</italic> and during attacks of aphidophagous
	larvae. CTKR effectively interrupted oviposition attempts of this
	parasitoid wasp and even repelled this parasitoid from colonies after
	evoking consecutive CTKRs. In contrast, solitary feeding <italic>A.
	nerii</italic> individuals were not able to successfully repel this
	parasitoid wasp. In addition, CTKR was also evoked through gentle
	substrate vibrations. Laser vibrometry of the substrate revealed
	twitching-associated vibrations that form a train of sharp acceleration
	peaks in the course of a CTKR. This suggests that visual signals
	in combination with twitching-related substrate vibrations may play
	an important role in synchronising defense among members of a colony.
	In both aphid species collective defense in encounters with different
	natural enemies was executed in a stereotypical way and was similar
	to CTKR evoked through visual stimulation. This cooperative defense
	behavior provides an example of a surprising sociality that can be
	found in some aphid species that are not expected to be social at
	all.</p>},

	Each individual agent within each group chooses in continuous or

	effort within each group provides within-group public goods which
	are used as an input in the between-group n-group competition for
	an external prize. Intergroup mobility and intergroup warfare are
	allowed for. Each group and each individual agent within each group
	get a fraction of the prize based on a linear combination of equity
	and relative effort. A model/algorithm is developed generating analytical

	abstract = {Evolutionary theory predicts that once an individual reaches an age
	of sufficiently low Darwinian fitness, (s)he will have reduced chances
	of keeping cancerous lesions in check. While we clearly need to better
	understand the emergence of precursor states and early malignancies
	as well as their mitigation by the microenvironment and tissue architecture,
	we argue that lifestyle changes and preventive therapies based in
	an evolutionary framework, applied to identified high-risk populations
	before incipient neoplasms become clinically detectable and chemoresistant
	lineages emerge, are currently the most reliable way to control or
	eliminate early tumours. Specifically, the relatively low levels
	of (epi)genetic heterogeneity characteristic of many if not most
	incipient lesions will mean a relatively limited set of possible
	adaptive traits and associated costs compared to more advanced cancers,
	and thus a more complete and predictable understanding of treatment
	options and outcomes. We propose a conceptual model for preventive
	treatments and discuss the many associated challenges.},

@article{hoffman:Oncogene:2008,
	abstract = {c-MYC has a pivotal function in growth control, differentiation and
	apoptosis, and its abnormal expression is associated with many tumors.
	Overexpression of c-MYC sensitizes cells to apoptosis by a variety
	of stimuli. The decision of a cell to undergo apoptosis and how this
	apoptotic response is regulated by c-MYC depends on the specific
	cell type and the physiological status of the cell. Multiple cooperating
	molecular pathways of cell survival and apoptosis determine whether
	a cell lives or dies, and understanding how c-MYC interfaces with
	these pathways to influence the survival of cells is important to
	understand normal and abnormal development, tumor initiation and
	progression, and response of tumors to different treatment regimens.
	This article will provide an overview of the function of the tumor
	suppressor gene product p53 in the c-MYC-mediated apoptotic response
	and how c-MYC amplifies the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway and triggers
	and/or amplifies the death receptor pathways. Finally, a model for
	how deregulated c-MYC prematurely triggers the normal apoptotic response
	associated with terminal myeloid differentiation while also blocking
	the differentiation program is presented.},

	to have occurred in 2008; of these, 56% of the cases and 64% of the
	deaths occurred in the economically developing world. Breast cancer
	is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of
	cancer death among females, accounting for 23% of the total cancer
	cases and 14% of the cancer deaths. Lung cancer is the leading cancer
	site in males, comprising 17% of the total new cancer cases and 23%
	of the total cancer deaths. Breast cancer is now also the leading
	cause of cancer death among females in economically developing countries,
	a shift from the previous decade during which the most common cause
	of cancer death was cervical cancer. Further, the mortality burden
	for lung cancer among females in developing countries is as high
	as the burden for cervical cancer, with each accounting for 11% of
	the total female cancer deaths. Although overall cancer incidence
	rates in the developing world are half those seen in the developed
	world in both sexes, the overall cancer mortality rates are generally
	similar. Cancer survival tends to be poorer in developing countries,
	most likely because of a combination of a late stage at diagnosis
	and limited access to timely and standard treatment. A substantial
	proportion of the worldwide burden of cancer could be prevented through
	the application of existing cancer control knowledge and by implementing
	programs for tobacco control, vaccination (for liver and cervical
	cancers), and early detection and treatment, as well as public health
	campaigns promoting physical activity and a healthier dietary intake.
	Clinicians, public health professionals, and policy makers can play
	an active role in accelerating the application of such interventions
	globally.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is curable in 60% of
	patients treated with rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,
	vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP). MYC translocations, with or
	without BCL2 translocations, have been associated with inferior survival
	in DLBCL. We investigated whether expression of MYC protein, with
	or without BCL2 protein expression, could risk-stratify patients
	at diagnosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We determined the correlation
	between presence of MYC and BCL2 proteins by immunohistochemistry
	(IHC) with survival in two independent cohorts of patients with DLBCL
	treated with R-CHOP. We further determined if MYC protein expression
	correlated with high MYC mRNA and/or presence of MYC translocation.
	RESULTS: In the training cohort (n = 167), MYC and BCL2 proteins
	were detected in 29% and 44% of patients, respectively. Concurrent
	expression (MYC positive/BCL2 positive) was present in 21% of patients.
	MYC protein correlated with presence of high MYC mRNA and MYC translocation
	(both P < .001), but the latter was less frequent (both 11%). MYC
	protein expression was only associated with inferior overall and
	progression-free survival when BCL2 protein was coexpressed (P <
	.001). Importantly, the poor prognostic effect of MYC positive/BCL2
	positive was validated in an independent cohort of 140 patients with
	DLBCL and remained significant (P < .05) after adjusting for presence
	of high-risk features in a multivariable model that included elevated
	international prognostic index score, activated B-cell molecular
	subtype, and presence of concurrent MYC and BCL2 translocations.
	CONCLUSION: Assessment of MYC and BCL2 expression by IHC represents
	a robust, rapid, and inexpensive approach to risk-stratify patients
	with DLBCL at diagnosis.},

	abstract = {The spatial distribution of organisms often differs across scales.
	For instance, colonial bird populations could be described, from
	large to small scale, as scattered clumps of otherwise regularly
	distributed breeding pairs. We analysed the distribution of nests
	of a large colonial population of white storks (Ciconia ciconia)
	and found a fractal pattern in each of the 4 study years. Moreover,
	we found that the often-observed, long-tailed frequency distribution
	of colony sizes was well described by a power law, regardless of
	the cut-off used to define colonies (from 16 to 1024 m). Thus,
	although storks were locally highly clumped even with tens of nests
	in a single tree, the population was not structured in colonies (a
	simple clustered distribution) as previously thought. Rather, they
	were distributed in a continuous hierarchical set of clusters within
	clusters across scales, clusters lacking the commonly assumed characteristic
	mean size. These quantitative solutions to previously perceived scaling
	problems will potentially improve our understanding of the ecology
	and evolution of bird coloniality and animal spacing patterns and
	group living in general.},

	abstract = {We report that two oncogenes coamplified on chromosome 3q26, PRKCI
	and SOX2, cooperate to drive a stem-like phenotype in lung squamous
	cell carcinoma (LSCC). Protein kinase Cι (PKCι) phosphorylates
	SOX2, a master transcriptional regulator of stemness, and recruits
	it to the promoter of Hedgehog (Hh) acyltransferase (HHAT) that catalyzes
	the rate-limiting step in Hh ligand production. PKCι-mediated SOX2
	phosphorylation is required for HHAT promoter occupancy, HHAT expression,
	and maintenance of a stem-like phenotype. Primary LSCC tumors coordinately
	overexpress PKCι, SOX2, and HHAT and require PKCι-SOX2-HHAT signaling
	to maintain a stem-like phenotype. Thus, PKCι and SOX2 are genetically,
	biochemically, and functionally linked in LSCC, and together they
	drive tumorigenesis by establishing a cell-autonomous Hh signaling
	axis.},

	abstract = {Epistatic interactions between mutations play a prominent role in
	evolutionary theories. Many studies have found that epistasis is
	widespread, but they have rarely considered beneficial mutations.
	We analyzed the effects of epistasis on fitness for the first five
	mutations to fix in an experimental population of Escherichia coli.
	Epistasis depended on the effects of the combined mutations--the
	larger the expected benefit, the more negative the epistatic effect.
	Epistasis thus tended to produce diminishing returns with genotype
	fitness, although interactions involving one particular mutation
	had the opposite effect. These data support models in which negative
	epistasis contributes to declining rates of adaptation over time.
	Sign epistasis was rare in this genome-wide study, in contrast to
	its prevalence in an earlier study of mutations in a single gene.},

	between children and adolescents on the one hand and adult patients

	We analyzed 65 cases of maB-NHL from patients up to 18 years of age
	by gene expression profiling, matrix comparative genomic hybridization
	(CGH), fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and immunohistochemistry.
	The majority of the analyzed pediatric patients were treated within
	prospective trials (n = 49). We compared this group to a series of
	182 previously published cases of adult maB-NHL. Gene expression
	profiling reclassified 31% of morphologically defined diffuse large
	B-cell lymphomas as molecular Burkitt lymphoma (mBL). The subgroups
	obtained by molecular reclassification did not show any difference
	in outcome in children treated with the NHL-Berlin-Frankfurt-Muenster
	(BFM) protocols. No differences were detectable between pediatric
	and adult mBL with regard to gene expression or chromosomal imbalances.
	This is the first report on molecular profiling of pediatric B-NHL
	showing mBL to be much more prominent in children than suggested
	by morphologic assessment. Based on molecular profiling mBL is a

@article{kluk:PlosOne:2012,
	abstract = {Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a clinically and genetically
	heterogeneous disease. A small subset of DLBCLs has translocations
	involving the MYC locus and an additional group has a molecular signature
	resembling Burkitt lymphoma (mBL). Presently, identification of such
	cases by morphology is unreliable and relies on cytogenetic or complex
	molecular methods such as gene transcriptional profiling. Herein,
	we describe an immunohistochemical (IHC) method for identifying DLBCLs
	with increased MYC protein expression. We tested 77 cases of DLBCL
	and identified 15 cases with high MYC protein expression (nuclear
	staining in >50% of tumor cells). All MYC translocation positive
	cases had increased MYC protein expression by this IHC assay. In
	addition, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the DLBCL transcriptional
	profiles revealed that tumors with increased MYC protein expression
	(regardless of underlying MYC translocation status) had coordinate
	upregulation of MYC target genes, providing molecular confirmation
	of the IHC results. We then generated a molecular classifier derived
	from the MYC IHC results in our cases and employed it to successfully
	classify mBLs from two previously reported independent case series,
	providing additional confirmation that the MYC IHC results identify
	clinically important subsets of DLBCLs. Lastly, we found that DLBCLs
	with high MYC protein expression had inferior overall survival when
	treated with R-CHOP. In conclusion, the IHC method described herein
	can be used to readily identify the biologically and clinically distinct
	cases of MYC-driven DLBCL, which represent a clinically significant
	subset of DLBCL cases due to their inferior overall survival.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we derive analytic solutions of stochastic mutation-selection
	networks that describe early events of cancer formation. A main assumption
	is that cancer is initiated in tissue compartments, where only a
	relatively small number of cells are at risk of mutating into cells
	that escape from homeostatic regulation. In this case, the evolutionary
	dynamics can be approximated by a low-dimensional stochastic process
	with a linear Kolmogorov forward equation that can be solved analytically.
	Most of the time, the cell population is homogeneous with respect
	to relevant mutations. Occasionally, such homogeneous states are
	connected by 'stochastic tunnels'. We give a precise analysis of
	the existence of tunnels and calculate the rate of tunneling. Finally,
	we calculate the conditions for chromosomal instability (CIN) to
	precede inactivation of the first tumor suppressor gene. In this
	case, CIN is an early event and a driving force of cancer progression.
	The techniques developed in this paper can be used to study arbitrarily
	complex mutation-selection networks of the somatic evolution of cancer.},

@article{komarova:JRSI:2014,
	abstract = {The evolution of complex traits requires the accumulation of multiple
	mutations, which can be disadvantageous, neutral or advantageous
	relative to the wild-type. We study two spatial (two-dimensional)
	models of fitness valley crossing (the constant-population Moran
	process and the non-constant-population contact process), varying
	the number of loci involved and the degree of mixing. We find that
	spatial interactions accelerate the crossing of fitness valleys in
	the Moran process in the context of neutral and disadvantageous intermediate
	mutants because of the formation of mutant islands that increase
	the lifespan of mutant lineages. By contrast, in the contact process,
	spatial structure can accelerate or delay the emergence of the complex
	trait, and there can even be an optimal degree of mixing that maximizes
	the rate of evolution. For advantageous intermediate mutants, spatial
	interactions always delay the evolution of complex traits, in both
	the Moran and contact processes. The role of the mutant islands here
	is the opposite: instead of protecting, they constrict the growth
	of mutants. We conclude that the laws of population growth can be
	crucial for the effect of spatial interactions on the rate of evolution,
	and we relate the two processes explored here to different biological
	situations.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This report provides detailed information on how the 2000
	Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) growth charts for
	the United States were developed, expanding upon the report that
	accompanied the initial release of the charts in 2000. METHODS: The
	growth charts were developed with data from five national health
	examination surveys and limited supplemental data. Smoothed percentile
	curves were developed in two stages. In the first stage, selected
	empirical percentiles were smoothed with a variety of parametric
	and nonparametric procedures. In the second stage, parameters were
	created to obtain the final curves, additional percentiles and z-scores.
	The revised charts were evaluated using statistical and graphical
	measures. RESULTS: The 1977 National Center for Health Statistics
	(NCHS) growth charts were revised for infants (birth to 36 months)
	and older children (2 to 20 years). New body mass index-for-age (BMI-for-age)
	charts were created. Use of national data improved the transition
	from the infant charts to those for older children. The evaluation
	of the charts found no large or systematic differences between the
	smoothed percentiles and the empirical data. CONCLUSION: The 2000
	CDC growth charts were developed with improved data and statistical
	procedures. Health care providers now have an instrument for growth
	screening that better represents the racial-ethnic diversity and
	combination of breast- and formula-feeding in the United States.
	It is recommended that these charts replace the 1977 NCHS charts
	when assessing the size and growth patterns of infants, children,
	and adolescents.},

	abstract = {Glioblastomas (GBMs) are the most common and malignant primary brain
	tumors and are aggressively treated with surgery, chemotherapy, and
	radiotherapy. Despite this treatment, recurrence is inevitable and
	survival has improved minimally over the last 50 years. Recent studies
	have suggested that GBMs exhibit both heterogeneity and instability
	of differentiation states and varying sensitivities of these states
	to radiation. Here, we employed an iterative combined theoretical
	and experimental strategy that takes into account tumor cellular
	heterogeneity and dynamically acquired radioresistance to predict
	the effectiveness of different radiation schedules. Using this model,
	we identified two delivery schedules predicted to significantly improve
	efficacy by taking advantage of the dynamic instability of radioresistance.
	These schedules led to superior survival in mice. Our interdisciplinary
	approach may also be applicable to other human cancer types treated
	with radiotherapy and, hence, may lay the foundation for significantly
	increasing the effectiveness of a mainstay of oncologic therapy.

	abstract = {Tribal war occurs when a coalition of individuals use force to seize
	reproduction-enhancing resources, and it may have affected human
	evolution. Here, we develop a population-genetic model for the coevolution
	of costly male belligerence and bravery when war occurs between groups
	of individuals in a spatially subdivided population. Belligerence
	is assumed to increase an actor&#039;s group probability of trying
	to conquer another group. An actor&#039;s bravery is assumed to increase
	his group&#039;s ability to conquer an attacked group. We show that
	the selective pressure on these two traits can be substantial even
	in groups of large size, and that they may be driven by two independent
	reproduction-enhancing resources: additional mates for males and
	additional territory (or material resources) for females. This has
	consequences for our understanding of the evolution of intertribal
	interactions, as hunter-gatherer societies are well known to have
	frequently raided neighbouring groups from whom they appropriated
	territory, goods and women.Keywords:},

	abstract = {We present a model of resource-limited population growth, competition, and predation based on what we believe to be biologically realistic assumptions about the relationship between resources and the growth of primary consumers and about the interaction of the primary consumers with the predators that prey upon them. Consideration is given to an equable habitat in which resources are continually supplied and wastes are continually removed. The general properties of this model are examined and two specific cases are studied in some detail: (i) one resource, one prey, and one predator, and (ii) one resource, two prey, and one predator. Particular consideration is given to the conditions which will permit the continued coexistence of the interacting populations. In conceiving this model we were guided by the specific case of bacteria and their virulent viruses. To study its validity we compare the theoretical predictions with the experimental results from continuous-culture populations of the bacterium E. coli and the phage T2. Structurally stable equilibria with all populations coexisting are possible when the number of distinct predator populations is not more than the number of distinct prey populations and the number of the latter is not more than the sum of the number of resources and the number of predator populations. For one resource, one prey, and one predator there are stable states of coexistence. Given specific resource utilization functions, the levels of these equilibria or oscillations and the range of parameter values required for stability can be determined. In situations where a stable equilibrium exists for the one predator-one prey system, a second population of primary consumers which is totally resistant to predation can also be maintained. Sufficient conditions for this to occur are that the resistant population have a lower intrinsic growth rate than the sensitive but that the former can, nevertheless, survive and multiply living on the resources present in the one predator-one prey system. If, however, this second species of primary consumer becomes slightly sensitive to predation, it may then entirely displace the original sensitive population. Stable equilibria were observed in glucose minimal continuous cultures containing T2 sensitive E. coli B and T2 phage. The equilibrium concentration of glucose and the densities of the populations were similar to those predicted by the model. However, with the estimated values of the parameters, the experimental system fell in the range where the model predicted that the oscillations would increase to the point where the populations would eventually become extinct. Stable equilibria were also observed for a glucose-limited chemostat culture containing T2 phage together with a T2-sensitive clone of E. coli B and a T2-resistant strain of E. coli K12. This system fulfilled the conditions under which the theory predicts that stable coexistence will occur. We discuss the validity of this model as a general analogue of resource limited growth, competition, and predation in planktonic species. We also consider the implications of these theoretical and experimental results for the general theory of competition and predation and for the specific problem of coexistence for bacteria and their virulent viruses.},

	follicular lymphoma, couples the bcl-2 protooncogene on chromosome
	18 to the immunoglobulin heavy-chain joining region (JH). This results
	in a deregulated transcription rate of bcl-2, suggesting a major
	role of the t(14;18) translocation in lymphomagenesis. By using a
	sensitive polymerase chain reaction technique specific for the major
	breakpoint region t(14;18), we now demonstrate the presence of bcl-2/JH
	rearrangements in lymph nodes and tonsils with follicular hyperplasia
	in 13 of 24 cases (54%). The approximate frequency was one translocation-positive
	cell in 10(5) cells. No bcl-2/JH rearrangements were detected in
	reactive lymph nodes without follicular hyperplasia or in bone marrow
	cells. Sequence analysis showed the amplified bcl-2/JH fragments
	to be unique to each individual sample and distinct from 24 sequenced
	follicular lymphoma-derived t(14;18) junctions, thus excluding contamination
	artifacts. The presence of random nucleotide insertions at the breakpoint
	junctions suggests a pre-B-cell origin of the t(14;18) translocation,
	in analogy with follicular lymphomas. We conclude that the t(14;18)
	translocation can occur in non-malignant tissue and will not, on
	its own, lead to malignancy.},

	abstract = {Techniques which identify hapten-specific B cells in tissues have
	been used to determine the sites of B cell activation in rat spleens
	in response to T cell-dependent (TD) antigens and T cell-independent
	type-1 (TI-1) antigens. Surface-associated hapten binding by specific
	memory B cells and B blasts was distinguished from the strong cytoplasmic
	hapten binding by specific plasma cells and plasmablasts. Blast cells
	in S phase were identified in tissue sections by staining cells which
	had been pulse labeled in vivo with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine. Hapten-specific
	B blast cells are found in three sites: (a) around interdigitating
	cells in the T cell-rich zones; (b) in the follicular dendritic cell
	network and (c) in association with macrophages in the red pulp.
	Hapten-binding memory B cells, which are not in cell cycle, accumulate
	in the marginal zones and to a lesser extent the follicular mantles
	in response to TD and TI-1 antigens. The hapten-specific blast response
	in T zones is confined to the first few days after antigen is given
	and is low for primary responses to TD antigens, but massive on secondary
	challenge, when marginal zone memory B cells migrate to the T zones.
	Both the primary and secondary T zone responses to TI-1 antigens
	are impressive and in these responses hapten-specific B blasts are
	also found in the splenic red pulp. The follicular response to TD
	antigens starts with a small number of B blasts (fewer than five)
	entering each follicle. These increase in number exponentially so
	that by the 4th day after immunization they fill the follicle. The
	oligoclonality of the response is shown in simultaneous responses
	to two haptens where 6%-31% of the follicles on day 3 after immunization
	contain blasts specific for only one of the two haptens. During the
	4th day classical zonal pattern of germinal centers develops. The
	surface immunoglobulin-positive B blasts are lost from the follicle
	center, while one pole of the follicular dendritic cell network fills
	with surface immunoglobulin-negative centroblasts. Centroblasts do
	not increase in numbers but divide to give rise to centrocytes, which
	re-express sIg and migrate into the follicular dendritic cell network.
	Cell kinetic studies indicate that the centrocyte population is renewed
	from centroblasts every 7 h. Centrocytes either leave the germinal
	center within this time or die in situ.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400

@article{lively:JH:2010,
	abstract = {I present a historical review of coevolutionary models for the evolutionary
	persistence of sexual reproduction. The focus is on the fate of obligately
	sexual populations facing competition with one or more obligately
	asexual clones. An early simulation model by Hamilton (Hamilton WD.
	1980. Sex versus non-sex versus parasite. Oikos. 35:282--290.) suggested
	that parasites could be an important force in selecting against asexual
	clones, leading to the persistence of sex. This result was consistent
	with a number of independent verbal models generated from 1975--1983.
	Conversely, the models by May and Anderson (May RM, Anderson RM.
	1983. Epidemiology and genetics in the coevolution of parasites and
	hosts. Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci. 219:281--313.), which included
	more epidemiological detail, suggested that parasites were an unlikely
	source of selection to favor sexual over asexual reproduction. Thus
	began an oscillation of opinion regarding the role of parasites in
	selection for sex. It would seem at present that some of the differences
	of opinion over time stemmed from the different ways that models
	were constructed, including whether the sexual population was in
	competition with a genetically diverse asexual population or a single
	clonal genotype. On theoretical grounds, parasite-mediated selection
	for sex seems more likely if the sexual population has options in
	genotypic space that are not available to the clones. Models that
	incorporate more ecological realism also seem more favorable to the
	parasite theory of sex.},

	abstract = {Why don't asexual females replace sexual females in most natural populations
	of eukaryotes? One promising explanation is that parasites could
	counter the reproductive advantages of asexual reproduction by exerting
	frequency-dependent selection against common clones (the Red Queen
	hypothesis). One apparent limitation of the Red Queen theory, however,
	is that parasites would seem to be required by theory to be highly
	virulent. In the present study, I present a population-dynamic view
	of competition between sexual females and asexual females that interact
	with co-evolving parasites. The results show that asexual populations
	have higher carrying capacities, and more unstable population dynamics,
	than sexual populations. The results also suggest that the spread
	of a clone into a sexual population could increase the effective
	parasite virulence as population density increases. This combination
	of parasite-mediated frequency-dependent selection, and density-dependent
	virulence, could lead to the coexistence of sexual and asexual reproductive
	strategies and the long-term persistence of sex.},

	of colorectal cancers in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
	Results registry, which covers approximately 10% of the U.S. population,
	while simultaneously adjusting for birth cohort and calendar year
	effects. The incidence of colorectal cancers in the Surveillance,
	Epidemiology, and End Results registry is most consistent with a
	model positing two rare events followed by a high-frequency event
	in the conversion of a normal stem cell into an initiated cell that
	expands clonally to give rise to an adenomatous polyp. Only one more
	rare event appears to be necessary for malignant transformation.
	The two rare events involved in initiation are interpreted to represent
	the homozygous loss of adenomatous polyposis coli gene function.
	The subsequent transition of a preinitiated stem cell into an initiated
	cell capable of clonal expansion via symmetric division is predicted
	to occur with a frequency too high for a mutational event but may
	reflect a positional effect in colonic crypts. Our results suggest
	it is not necessary to invoke genomic instability to explain colorectal
	cancer incidence rates in human populations. Temporal trends in the
	incidence of colon cancer appear to be dominated by calendar year
	effects. The model also predicts that interventions, such as administration
	of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, designed to decrease the
	growth rate of adenomatous polyps, are very efficient at lowering
	colon cancer risk substantially, even when begun later in life. By
	contrast, interventions that decrease the rate of mutations at the
	adenomatous polyposis coli locus are much less effective in reducing
	the risk of colon cancer.},

	abstract = {Chromosome banding analyses reveal secondary chromosome abnormalities
	in addition to the MYC translocations t(8;14)(q24;q32), t(8;22)(q24;q11),
	and t(2;8)(p11;q24) in 60%-80% of Burkitt lymphomas/leukemias (BL).
	The high incidence of such aberrations indicates that additional
	changes are important, perhaps necessary, for malignant transformation,
	i.e., the 8q24/MYC rearrangements may not be sufficient. To investigate
	this possibility, we performed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
	array analysis on 20 cases of 8q24/MYC-positive BL. Nineteen (95%)
	harbored genomic imbalances; the only case without such aberrations
	displayed secondary changes by chromosome banding analysis. Thus,
	all BL cases had abnormalities in addition to the 8q24 translocation.
	The adult cases harbored more changes (median 3; range 1-21) than
	did the childhood cases (median 1.5; range 0-5) (P = 0.034). Several
	recurrent aberrations were detected by SNP array analysis, in particular
	losses of 6q14.1-q22.33, 9p21.3, and 13q14.2-q14.3, gains of 1q23.3-q31.3,
	chromosome 7, 13q31.3, and partial uniparental isodisomies for 6p12.2-pter,
	9p23-pter, and 17p11.2-pter. The molecular genetic consequences of
	these changes include deletions of the CDKN2A and TP53 genes, and
	gains/losses of several genes, such as MIR17HG and E2F2K, involved
	in the MYC pathway. Thus, deregulation of the MYC pathway, both directly
	through the 8q24/MYC translocation and indirectly through secondary
	genomic imbalances, may be essential not only for the initiation
	but also for the progression of BL.},

@article{ma:JTB:2011,
	abstract = {Several empirical studies have shown that the animal group size distribution
	of many species can be well fit by power laws with exponential truncation.
	A striking empirical result due to Niwa is that the exponent in these
	power laws is one and the truncation is determined by the average
	group size experienced by an individual. This distribution is known
	as the logarithmic distribution. In this paper we provide first principles
	derivation of the logarithmic distribution and other truncated power
	laws using a site-based merge and split framework. In particular,
	we investigate two such models. Firstly, we look at a model in which
	groups merge whenever they meet but split with a constant probability
	per time step. This generates a distribution similar, but not identical
	to the logarithmic distribution. Secondly, we propose a model, based
	on preferential attachment, that produces the logarithmic distribution
	exactly. Our derivation helps explain why logarithmic distributions
	are so widely observed in nature. The derivation also allows us to
	link splitting and joining behavior to the exponent and truncation
	parameters in power laws.},

	abstract = {It is now widely recognized that cancer development is a protracted
	process requiring the stepwise acquisition of multiple oncogenic
	events. In humans, this process can take decades, if not a lifetime,
	blurring the notion of 'healthy' individuals. Follicular lymphoma
	exemplifies this multistep pathway of oncogenesis. In recent years,
	variants of follicular lymphoma have been recognized that appear
	to represent clonal B-cell expansions at an early stage of follicular
	lymphoma lymphomagenesis. These include follicular lymphoma in situ,
	duodenal follicular lymphoma, partial involvement by follicular lymphoma,
	and in the blood circulating follicular lymphoma-like B cells. Recent
	genetic studies have identified similarities and differences between
	the early lesions and overt follicular lymphoma, providing important
	information for understanding their biological evolution. The data
	indicate that there is already genomic instability at these early
	stages, even in instances with a low risk for clinical progression.
	The overexpression of BCL2 in t(14;18)-positive B cells puts them
	at risk for subsequent genetic aberrations when they re-enter the
	germinal center and are exposed to the influences of activation-induced
	cytidine deaminase and somatic hypermutations. The emerging data
	provide a rationale for clinical management and, in the future, may
	identify genetic risk factors that warrant early therapeutic intervention.},

@article{martens:NJP:2011,
	abstract = {Cancer results from a sequence of genetic and epigenetic changes which
	lead to a variety of abnormal phenotypes including increased proliferation
	and survival of somatic cells, and thus, to a selective advantage
	of pre-cancerous cells. The notion of cancer progression as an evolutionary
	process has been experiencing increasing interest in recent years.
	Many efforts have been made to better understand and predict the
	progression to cancer using mathematical models; these mostly consider
	the evolution of a well-mixed cell population, even though pre-cancerous
	cells often evolve in highly structured epithelial tissues. In this
	study, we propose a novel model of cancer progression that considers
	a spatially structured cell population where clones expand via adaptive
	waves. This model is used to assess two different paradigms of asexual
	evolution that have been suggested to delineate the process of cancer
	progression. The standard scenario of periodic selection assumes
	that driver mutations are accumulated strictly sequentially over
	time. However, when the mutation supply is sufficiently high, clones
	may arise simultaneously on distinct genetic backgrounds, and clonal
	adaptation waves interfere with each other. We find that in the presence
	of clonal interference, spatial structure increases the waiting time
	for cancer, leads to a patchwork structure of non-uniformly sized
	clones, decreases the survival probability of virtually neutral (passenger)
	mutations, and that genetic distance begins to increase over a characteristic
	length scale L(c). These characteristic features of clonal interference
	may help to predict the onset of cancers with pronounced spatial
	structure and to interpret spatially-sampled genetic data obtained
	from biopsies. Our estimates suggest that clonal interference likely
	occurs in the progression of colon cancer, and possibly other cancers
	where spatial structure matters.},

	in germinal center reactions has been investigated in a number of
	recent experiments. These have revealed cell migration patterns,
	asymmetric cell divisions, and cell-cell interaction characteristics,
	used here to develop a theory of germinal center B cell selection,
	division, and exit (the LEDA model). According to this model, B cells
	selected by T follicular helper cells on the basis of successful
	antigen processing always return to the dark zone for asymmetric
	division, and acquired antigen is inherited by one daughter cell
	only. Antigen-retaining B cells differentiate to plasma cells and
	leave the germinal center through the dark zone. This theory has
	implications for the functioning of germinal centers because compared
	to previous models, high-affinity antibodies appear one day earlier
	and the amount of derived plasma cells is considerably larger.},

	No correlation between the presence of these aberrant lymphocytes

	of the recombined c-myc was investigated for the presence of point
	mutations and these were found in the nonpersistent clones. Additional

	abstract = {Chromosomal translocations that juxtapose one of the three immunoglobulin
	loci to the c-myc protooncogene are the hallmark of Burkitt lymphomas
	(BLs), whether they carry the Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) or not. Ig/myc
	translocations occur as accidents of normal B lymphocyte differentiation.
	Unless protected, the translocation carrying cells are apoptosis
	prone. However, the high B cell stimulatory cytokine level found
	in the two BL prone conditions, in chronic hyperendemic malaria and
	HIV infection, may rescue them. X-linked lymphoproliferative disease
	(XLP) is due to the lack of functional SAP protein, a consequence
	of mutation or deletion of the SAP gene. We and others have shown
	that SAP is pro-apoptotic. Here we summarize our finding that 8 of
	10 EBV carrying, but none of 9 EBV negative BL lines express SAP.
	We suggest that the apoptosis prone Ig/myc translocation carrying
	EBV negative precursors of BL can only grow into lymphomas if they
	do not express SAP. However, their EBV positive counterparts are
	permissive for SAP expression, due to the anti-apoptotic function
	of EBNA-1.},

	abstract = {The c-Myc HLH-bZIP protein has been implicated in physiological or
	pathological growth, proliferation, apoptosis, metabolism, and differentiation
	at the cellular, tissue, or organismal levels via regulation of numerous
	target genes. No principle yet unifies Myc action due partly to an
	incomplete inventory and functional accounting of Myc's targets.
	To observe Myc target expression and function in a system where Myc
	is temporally and physiologically regulated, the transcriptomes and
	the genome-wide distributions of Myc, RNA polymerase II, and chromatin
	modifications were compared during lymphocyte activation and in ES
	cells as well. A remarkably simple rule emerged from this quantitative
	analysis: Myc is not an on-off specifier of gene activity, but is
	a nonlinear amplifier of expression, acting universally at active
	genes, except for immediate early genes that are strongly induced
	before Myc. This rule of Myc action explains the vast majority of
	Myc biology observed in literature.},

	share of cooperators in the population should also increase. It is
	well known that positive assortment between cooperative types, for
	instance in spatially structured populations, provide better conditions
	for the evolution of cooperation than complete mixing. This study
	demonstrates that, assuming positive assortment, under most conditions
	higher cooperation benefits also increase the share of cooperators.
	On the other hand, under a specified range of payoff values, when
	at least two payoff parameters are modified, the reverse is true.
	The conditions for this paradox are determined for two-person social
	dilemmas: the Prisoner's Dilemma, the Hawks and Doves game, and the
	Stag Hunt game, assuming global selection and positive assortment.},

	(BL) have been described extensively. However, to the authors' knowledge,
	very limited studies have focused on the secondary chromosomal abnormalities
	in pediatric BL as compared with those of adult BL and on their prognostic
	impact. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed in all pediatric
	and adult patients at 2 institutions, with a morphologic diagnosis
	of BL, pretherapy tumor karyotype available, and t(8;14), t(8;22),
	or t(2;8) present. RESULTS: There were 33 children and 37 adults.
	The majority of the patients (95%) had Stage III/IV disease. There
	were no statistically significant differences noted in karyotype
	complexity and the nature of the chromosomal abnormalities between
	these 2 groups. Abnormalities of chromosomes 13 (13q) and 22 (22q)
	had a negative impact on prognosis in children. In adults, abnormalities
	of chromosome 17 appeared to have a negative impact. CONCLUSIONS:
	The current findings suggest that karyotypic information can be used
	for refining risk stratification in patients with BL.},

	depend on the assumption that pathogens are narrowly specialized,
	so that high fitness on one host genotype results in poor fitness
	on hosts with other allele combinations. This assumption is necessary
	in order for frequency-dependent selection to produce sustained cycling
	of gametic disequilibrium across the host's disease resistance loci,
	which makes recombination advantageous. However, a review of numerous
	genetic studies on plant disease resistance failed to uncover a single
	example consistent with this assumption. Instead, the empirical results
	provide strong support for a different pattern of pathogen specificity,
	in which adaptation by pathogens to one resistance allele does not
	preclude high fitness on alternate host genotypes lacking that allele.
	Modification of traditional models for pathogen-mediated evolution
	of sex showed that for conditions close to the empirical pattern
	of genotypic specificity, sex is almost never favoured. For plants,
	these results cast doubt on current theories arguing that pathogens
	are the primary selective agent responsible for sexual reproduction.},

	Lotka-Volterra model of predator-prey interaction. Fluctuation effects
	due to discreteness of the populations destroy the mean-field stability

	species. We show that the corresponding extinction time scales as
	a certain power-law of the population sizes. This behavior should

	abstract = {To explore the role of c-Myc in carcinogenesis, we have developed
	a reversible transgenic model of pancreatic beta cell oncogenesis
	using a switchable form of the c-Myc protein. Activation of c-Myc
	in adult, mature beta cells induces uniform beta cell proliferation
	but is accompanied by overwhelming apoptosis that rapidly erodes
	beta cell mass. Thus, the oncogenic potential of c-Myc in beta cells
	is masked by apoptosis. Upon suppression of c-Myc-induced beta cell
	apoptosis by coexpression of Bcl-x(L), c-Myc triggers rapid and uniform
	progression into angiogenic, invasive tumors. Subsequent c-Myc deactivation
	induces rapid regression associated with vascular degeneration and
	beta cell apoptosis. Our data indicate that highly complex neoplastic
	lesions can be both induced and maintained in vivo by a simple combination
	of two interlocking molecular lesions.},

	societies, are inherently more complex than interactions among particles
	and non-living matter. Group interactions are a particularly important
	and widespread class, representative of which is the public goods
	game. In addition, methods of statistical physics have proved valuable
	for studying pattern formation, equilibrium selection and self-organization
	in evolutionary games. Here, we review recent advances in the study
	of evolutionary dynamics of group interactions on top of structured
	populations, including lattices, complex networks and coevolutionary
	models. We also compare these results with those obtained on well-mixed
	populations. The review particularly highlights that the study of
	the dynamics of group interactions, like several other important
	equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamical processes in biological,
	economical and social sciences, benefits from the synergy between
	statistical physics, network science and evolutionary game theory.},

	the dynamics are generated by a Hamiltonian system with respect to
	an appropriately chosen Poisson structure. For odd dimensions the
	dynamics are Hamiltonian if there is a continuum of interior fixed
	points, and gradient-like if the interior fixed point is unique.
	In this case the invariant hyperplane is part of the ω -limit set,
	and the dynamics restricted to this set are those of a Hamiltonian
	system. Furthermore, an example of a completely integrable four-dimensional
	Hamiltonian Lotka-Volterra system is presented.},

	abstract = {Kin and multilevel selection theories predict that genetic structure
	is required for the evolution of cooperation. However, local competition
	among relatives can limit cooperative benefits, antagonizing the
	evolution of cooperation. We show that several ecological factors
	determine the extent to which kin competition constrains cooperative
	benefits. In addition, we argue that cooperative acts that expand
	local carrying capacity are less constrained by kin competition than
	other cooperative traits, and are therefore more likely to evolve.
	These arguments are particularly relevant to microbial cooperation,
	which often involves the production of public goods that promote
	population expansion. The challenge now is to understand how an organism's
	ecology influences how much cooperative groups contribute to future
	generations and thereby the evolution of cooperation.},

@article{radmacher:ICB:1998,
	abstract = {The germinal centre reaction (GCR) is a fundamental component of the
	immune response to T-dependent antigens, during which the immunoglobulin
	(Ig) genes of B cells experience somatic hypermutation and selection.
	A maximum-likelihood method on DNA sequence data from 16 individual
	germinal centres was used to infer that the waiting time for position
	33 key (high-affinity) mutations in the anti-(4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl)
	acetyl (NP) response is 8.3 days. This is in marked contrast to the
	prediction of a key mutant each generation (waiting time about 1/3
	day) obtained from a simple model and parameters available in the
	literature. This disagreement is resolved in part by the finding
	that the targeted base occurs in a cold spot for hypermutation, raising
	the predicted waiting time to 2.3 days, although this value remains
	significantly lower than that inferred from the sequence data. It
	is proposed that the remaining disparity is attributable to some
	further stochastic process in the GCR: many early key mutations arise
	but fail to 'take root' within the GC, either due to emigration or
	failure of cognate T cell/B cell interaction. Furthermore, it is
	argued that the frequency with which position 33 mutations are found
	in secondary responses to NP indicates the presence of selection
	after the GCR.},

	conflicts under conditions of intergroup competition. The paradigm
	constitutes an n-person game with imperfect and incomplete information
	in which the n players are divided into two groups, are each assigned
	monetary endowment, and must then decide independently and anonymously
	whether to keep the endowment or contribute it to the group's benefit.
	The group with the larger sum of contributions is provided with a
	monetary reward (binary public good), which is shared equally among
	all of its members regardless of their decision. Two alternative
	models are proposed and their testable implications are derived and
	discussed. Both assume maximization of expected utility, but their
	assumptions about the expectations each player holds about the decisions
	of the remaining players are different. The effects of predecisional
	communication are examined and several extensions of the basic paradigm

	abstract = {Population structure affects the relative influence of selection and
	drift on the change in allele frequencies. Several models have been
	proposed recently, using diffusion approximations to calculate fixation
	probabilities, fixation times, and equilibrium properties of subdivided
	populations. We propose here a simple method to construct diffusion
	approximations in structured populations; it relies on general expressions
	for the expectation and variance in allele frequency change over
	one generation, in terms of partial derivatives of a ``fitness function''
	and probabilities of genetic identity evaluated in a neutral model.
	In the limit of a very large number of demes, these probabilities
	can be expressed as functions of average allele frequencies in the
	metapopulation, provided that coalescence occurs on two different
	timescales, which is the case in the island model. We then use the
	method to derive expressions for the probability of fixation of new
	mutations, as a function of their dominance coefficient, the rate
	of partial selfing, and the rate of deme extinction. We obtain more
	precise approximations than those derived by recent work, in particular
	(but not only) when deme sizes are small. Comparisons with simulations
	show that the method gives good results as long as migration is stronger
	than selection.},

	and its variants leading to activation of the MYC oncogene. It is
	a matter of debate whether true BL without MYC translocation exists.
	Here, we identified 59 lymphomas concordantly called BL by 2 gene
	expression classifiers among 753 B-cell lymphomas. Only 2 (3%) of
	these 59 molecular BL lacked a MYC translocation, which both shared
	a peculiar pattern of chromosome 11q aberration characterized by
	interstitial gains including 11q23.2-q23.3 and telomeric losses of
	11q24.1-qter. We extended our analysis to 17 MYC-negative high-grade
	B-cell lymphomas with a similar 11q aberration and showed this aberration
	to be recurrently associated with morphologic and clinical features
	of BL. The minimal region of gain was defined by high-level amplifications
	in 11q23.3 and associated with overexpression of genes including
	PAFAH1B2 on a transcriptional and protein level. The recurrent region
	of loss contained a focal homozygous deletion in 11q24.2-q24.3 including
	the ETS1 gene, which was shown to be mutated in 4 of 16 investigated
	cases. These findings indicate the existence of a molecularly distinct
	subset of B-cell lymphomas reminiscent of BL, which is characterized
	by deregulation of genes in 11q.},

	abstract = {It has long been recognized that the border between classical Burkitt's
	lymphoma (BL) and classical diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)
	is hard to determine. Instead, both classical lymphoma entities seem
	to be the extreme ends of a spectrum of diseases that contains a
	group of lymphomas characterized predominately by the fact that they
	are hard to assign to the one or the other group. This gray zone
	has been recently termed "lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features
	intermediate between DLBCL and BL" by the updated WHO classification.
	The term "intermediate" resembles that from a recent gene-expression
	study of mature aggressive B-cell lymphomas, although, notably, it
	is used differently. Intermediate lymphomas according to the WHO
	classification clearly are a temporary container of different biologic
	subtypes of aggressive lymphoma, from which several might be associated
	with an unfavorable clinical outcome. The present review aims at
	describing the morphologic, clinical, and biologic heterogeneity
	of the intermediate lymphomas and, moreover, attempts to propose
	testable subgroups based on age and presence of genetic aberrations.},

@article{salaverria:HAE:2008,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Burkitt's lymphoma is an aggressive B-cell lymphoma characterized
	by typical morphological, immunophenotypic and molecular features.
	Gene expression profiling provided a molecular signature of Burkitt's
	lymphoma, but also demonstrated that a subset of aggressive B-cell
	lymphomas not fulfilling the current World Health Organization criteria
	for the diagnosis of Burkitt's lymphoma nonetheless show a molecular
	signature of Burkitt's lymphoma ('discrepant Burkitt's lymphoma').
	Given the different treatment of Burkitt's lymphoma and diffuse large
	B-cell lymphomas we investigated molecular differences within gene
	expression-defined Burkitt's lymphoma. DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied
	tumors from 51 Burkitt's lymphoma patients, comprising 26 with classic
	Burkitt's lymphoma, 17 with atypical Burkitt's lymphoma and 8 with
	'discrepant Burkitt's lymphoma', by comparative genomic hybridization
	and gene expression profiling. RESULTS: Classic and atypical Burkitt's
	lymphoma (excluding 'discrepant Burkitt's lymphoma'), in adult and
	pediatric cases do not differ in underlying genomic imbalances or
	gene expression suggesting that these subgroups are molecularly homogeneous.
	'Discrepant Burkitt's lymphoma', however, differ dramatically in
	the absolute number of alterations from classic/atypical Burkitt's
	lymphoma and from diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Moreover, this category
	includes lymphomas that carry both the t(14;18) and t(8;14) translocations
	and are clinically characterized by presentation in adult patients
	and an aggressive course. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric and adult Burkitt's
	lymphoma are molecularly homogeneous, whereas 'discrepant Burkitt's
	lymphoma' differ in underlying genetic and clinical features from
	typical/atypical Burkitt's lymphoma. 'Discrepant Burkitt's lymphoma'
	may therefore form a distinct genetic subgroup of aggressive B-cell
	lymphomas, which show poor response to multi-agent chemotherapy.},

	abstract = {A traditional picture of evolutionary dynamics with constant fitness
	is that of genomes living in sequence space and adapting on fitness
	landscapes. Mutation rates are considered to be constant or externally
	regulated. If, however, we take into account that genomes also encode
	for enzymes that perform replication and error correction, then individual
	genomes not only have a specific replication rate (fitness), but
	also a specific mutation rate. This leads to the concept of a mutation
	landscape. We explore evolution on mutation landscapes. Localization
	in pure mutation landscapes is only possible under extremely restrictive
	conditions. Coupling of mutation landscapes and fitness landscapes
	leads to localization and hence adaptation and evolution. We analyse
	how mutation landscapes facilitate localization in fitness landscapes
	and vice versa. Finally, we show that for mutation landscapes, at
	equilibrium, with constant environment, there is not necessarily
	selection for the minimum mutation rate. Instead, the target of selection
	is an optimum distribution of mutation rates, a 'mutational quasispecies'.},

@article{schmitz:cshp:2014,
	abstract = {Burkitt lymphoma is a germinal center B-cell-derived cancer that was
	instrumental in the identification of MYC as an important human oncogene
	more than three decades ago. Recently, new genomics technologies
	have uncovered several additional oncogenic mechanisms that cooperate
	with MYC to create this highly aggressive cancer. The transcription
	factor TCF-3 is central to Burkitt lymphoma pathogenesis. TCF-3 is
	rendered constitutively active in Burkitt lymphoma by two related
	mechanisms: (1) somatic mutations that inactivate its negative regulator
	ID3, and (2) somatic mutations in TCF-3 that block the ability of
	ID3 to bind and interfere with its activity as a transcription factor.
	TCF-3 is also a master regulator of normal germinal center B-cell
	differentiation. Within the germinal center, TCF-3 up-regulates genes
	that are characteristically expressed in the rapidly dividing centroblasts,
	the putative cell of origin for Burkitt lymphoma, while repressing
	genes expressed in the less proliferative centrocytes. TCF-3 promotes
	antigen-independent (tonic) B-cell-receptor signaling in Burkitt
	lymphoma by transactivating immunoglobulin heavy- and light-chain
	genes while repressing PTPN6, which encodes the phosphatase SHP-1,
	a negative regulator of B-cell-receptor signaling. Tonic B-cell-receptor
	signaling sustains Burkitt lymphoma survival by engaging the PI3
	kinase pathway. In addition, TCF-3 promotes cell-cycle progression
	by transactivating CCND3, encoding a D-type cyclin that regulates
	the G1-S phase transition. Additionally, CCND3 accumulates oncogenic
	mutations that stabilize cyclin D3 protein expression and drive proliferation.
	These new insights into Burkitt lymphoma pathogenesis suggest new
	therapeutic strategies, which are sorely needed in developing regions
	of the world where this cancer is endemic.},

	tumor growth by destroying cancer cells or inhibiting their outgrowth
	but also promote tumor progression either by selecting for tumor
	cells that are more fit to survive in an immunocompetent host or
	by establishing conditions within the tumor microenvironment that
	facilitate tumor outgrowth. Here, we discuss a unifying conceptual

	abstract = {A two-species genetic model of host-parasite interaction is used to study the dynamical consequences of varying the number of genotypes in each species, and the recombination rate in the host. With two genotypes in each species, the model's behaviour is very simple; there is either a stable interior equilibrium, a stable cycle or a smooth outward spiral toward the boundaries. But with three or more genotypes, complex cycles and apparently chaotic behaviour may arise over wide ranges of parameter values. Increasing the number of genotypes also tends to slow the rate of gene-frequency change. Recombination in the host does not affect the stability of the interior fixed point, but intermediate rates of recombination may give dynamic stability to an otherwise dynamically unstable pattern of cycling. Intermediate rates of recombination also tend to decrease the amplitudes of gene-frequency cycles in the host, which implies that they could promote the accumulation of genetic variation involved in complementary, antagonistic interactions with parasites.},

	an increase of cooperation strategy in its strategy distribution,
	we deduced that the substance of a dilemma can be expressed by a
	productive summation of the static factor and the dynamic factor
	independently. A static factor is an element of the game's structure
	that influences a possible dilemma, which relates to a game's structural
	deviation from a situation where the cooperation strategy can be
	weakly dominant over other strategies. In contrast, a dynamic factor
	refers to a strategy distribution's influence on the dilemma by affecting
	the game dynamics. In a 2 × 2 game, the existence of a dilemma can
	be determined only by a static factor. That is, whether or not a
	dilemma occurs is related only to the structural effect of the game.
	On the other hand, in a more-than-two-strategies game, both static
	and dynamic factors determine the occurrence of a dilemma, and the
	static factor cannot solely explain the occurrence of a dilemma.},

	abstract = {AIMS: MYC gene translocation entails a bad prognosis and a poor response
	to rituximab-cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone
	(R-CHOP) in diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL), and more intensive
	chemotherapy regimens could be more effective in those cases. Its
	evaluation requires cytogenetic or fluorescence in-situ hybridization
	(FISH) studies, which are expensive and not widely available. The
	aim of this work was to find an immunohistochemical marker able to
	be used as a screening tool to identify MYC translocations. METHODS
	AND RESULTS: Aggressive B cell lymphomas in which MYC status was
	assessed during their diagnostic work-up between 2007 and 2010 were
	collected, their immunophenotype was re-evaluated, and were stratified
	according to the Hans algorithm. Two tissue microarrays were built
	in order to evaluate MYC protein expression with a commercially available
	antibody. The study was performed on 56 specimens: nine Burkitt lymphomas
	(eight translocated), 45 DLBCLs (nine translocated) and two lymphomas
	with intermediate features (both translocated). Only MYC protein
	expression detected by immunohistochemistry correlated with MYC translocation.
	No relationship was seen between MYC gene copies and protein expression.
	CONCLUSIONS: MYC protein expression detected by immunohistochemistry
	using a commercially available antibody correlates with MYC gene
	translocation, and could be used as a screening tool to select those
	cases in which confirmatory genetic testing is mandatory.},

	abstract = {Abstract How should we measure the relative selective advantage of
	different behavioral strategies? The various approaches to this question
	have fallen into one of the following categories: the fixation probability
	of a mutant allele in a wild type population, some measures of gene
	frequency and gene frequency change, and a formulation of the inclusive
	fitness effect. Countless theoretical studies have examined the relationship
	between these approaches, and it has generally been thought that,
	under standard simplifying assumptions, they yield equivalent results.
	Most of this theoretical work, however, has assumed homogeneity of
	the population interaction structure---that is, that all individuals
	are equivalent. We explore the question of selective advantage in
	a general (heterogeneous) population and show that, although appropriate
	measures of fixation probability and gene frequency change are equivalent,
	they are not, in general, equivalent to the inclusive fitness effect.
	The latter does not reflect effects of selection acting via mutation,
	which can arise on heterogeneous structures, even for low mutation.
	Our theoretical framework provides a transparent analysis of the
	different biological factors at work in the comparison of these fitness
	measures and suggests that their theoretical and empirical use needs
	to be revised and carefully grounded in a more general theory.},

@article{thrall:JE:1997,
	abstract = {1 The metapopulation concept is useful when considering ecological
	and evolutionary dynamics of spatially structured populations. However,
	debate has focused on genetic variation that is neutral rather than
	under selection. This distinction is particularly important in antagonistic
	or co-evolutionary interactions such as host-pathogen or predator-prey
	systems. Plant host-pathogen systems provide some of the best examples
	of studies in which numerical and genetic dynamics have been investigated
	in a spatially explicit context, and where genes under selection
	can be unambiguously identified. 2 Empirical studies of natural host-pathogen
	interactions have shown that, while in some cases pathogens appear
	to be locally adapted to their hosts, in others there is no local
	correspondence between resistance and virulence genes. Recent theory
	suggests that the dynamics (epidemic vs. endemic) and migration rates
	of host and pathogen will be important factors in the maintenance
	of genetic polymorphisms in resistance and virulence. 3 We argue
	that the relative spatial scales at which hosts and pathogens interact
	are crucial to understanding the evolution of resistance/virulence
	structure. Pathogens that disperse further than their hosts will
	be more likely to show gene-for-gene interactions than pathogens
	dispersing over spatial scales similar to or smaller than their hosts.
	4 We predict that life-history features that influence encounter
	rates between specific host and pathogen genotypes will be important
	factors in determining the evolution of resistance-virulence structures.
	In particular, we would expect correlative and/or causal relationships
	between pathogen life-history features [e.g. local vs. systemic infection,
	type (fecundity vs. mortality) and severity of effects], and whether
	dynamics are endemic or epidemic. 5 Plant host-pathogen systems provide
	ideal models for investigating the evolution of non-neutral genetic
	variation in spatial systems. Understanding the co-evolution of such
	systems will require research programmes that integrate long-term
	descriptive and experimental studies of multiple populations, with
	analytical and computer simulation modelling and comparative/phylogenetic
	studies.},

	abstract = {Although it has been hypothesized that some of the somatic mutations
	found in tumors may occur before tumor initiation, there is little
	experimental or conceptual data on this topic. To gain insights into
	this fundamental issue, we formulated a mathematical model for the
	evolution of somatic mutations in which all relevant phases of a
	tissue's history are considered. The model makes the prediction,
	validated by our empirical findings, that the number of somatic mutations
	in tumors of self-renewing tissues is positively correlated with
	the age of the patient at diagnosis. Importantly, our analysis indicates
	that half or more of the somatic mutations in certain tumors of self-renewing
	tissues occur before the onset of neoplasia. The model also provides
	a unique way to estimate the in vivo tissue-specific somatic mutation
	rates in normal tissues directly from the sequencing data of tumors.
	Our results have substantial implications for the interpretation
	of the large number of genome-wide cancer studies now being undertaken.},

	Duke University{\^a}µ* Corresponding author; email: vancleve{at}nescent.orgAbstractThe
	evolution of social traits remains one of the most fascinating and
	feisty topics in evolutionary biology even after half a century of
	theoretical research. W. D. Hamilton shaped much of the field initially
	with his 1964 papers that laid out the foundation for understanding
	the effect of genetic relatedness on the evolution of social behavior.
	Early theoretical investigations revealed two critical assumptions
	required for Hamilton&#039;s rule to hold in dynamical models: weak
	selection and additive genetic interactions. However, only recently
	have analytical approaches from population genetics and evolutionary
	game theory developed sufficiently so that social evolution can be
	studied under the joint action of selection, mutation, and genetic
	drift. We review how these approaches suggest two timescales for
	evolution under weak mutation: (i) a short-term timescale where evolution
	occurs between a finite set of alleles, and (ii) a long-term timescale
	where a continuum of alleles are possible and populations evolve
	continuously from one monomorphic trait to another. We show how Hamilton&#039;s
	rule emerges from the short-term analysis under additivity and how
	non-additive genetic interactions can be accounted for more generally.
	This short-term approach reproduces, synthesizes, and generalizes
	many previous results including the one-third law from evolutionary
	game theory and risk dominance from economic game theory. Using the
	long-term approach, we illustrate how trait evolution can be described
	with a diffusion equation that is a stochastic analogue of the canonical
	equation of adaptive dynamics. Peaks in the stationary distribution
	of the diffusion capture classic notions of convergence stability
	from evolutionary game theory and generally depend on the additive
	genetic interactions inherent in Hamilton&#039;s rule. Surprisingly,
	the peaks of the long-term stationary distribution can predict the
	effects of simple kinds of non-additive interactions. Additionally,
	the peaks may capture the effect of both weak and strong selection
	in a manner analogous to classic diffusion approaches in population
	genetics. Together, the results from the short and long-term approaches
	suggest both how Hamilton&#039;s insight may be robust in unexpected
	ways and how current analytical approaches can expand our understanding
	of social evolution far beyond Hamilton&#039;s original work.Received

	some of the families shown to have no germline TP53 mutation, germline
	hChk2 mutations have been described. In some cases the functional
	consequences of the latter have been demonstrated, although there
	are still relatively few reports of such mutations. Due to the paucity
	of families currently described with hChk2 mutations, it is not possible
	to reach any conclusions concerning the phenotypic/clinical differences
	between the two types of germline mutation. At least one family with
	a germline hChk2 mutation is a classic LFS family, whereas others
	are LFL, variant-LFS, or phenotypically suggestive of LFS. However,
	there is still a significant number of LFS/LFL families for which
	no underlying genetic determinant has been identified. It will be
	fascinating to see what genetic defects are responsible, and whether

	the difference between the B cells in each of these zones in humans

	show that LZ and DZ cells in mice and humans differ only in the expression
	of characteristic "activation" and "proliferation" programs, suggesting
	that these populations represent alternating states of a single-cell
	type rather than distinct differentiation stages. In addition, LZ/DZ
	transcriptional profiling shows that, with the exception of "molecular"
	Burkitt lymphomas, nearly all human B-cell malignancies closely resemble
	LZ cells, which has important implications for our understanding

	abstract = {The c-Myc protein, encoded by c-myc gene, in its wild-type form can
	induce tumors with a high frequency and can induce massive programmed
	cell death (PCD) in most transgenic mouse models, with greater efficiency
	than other oncogenes. Evidence also indicates that c-Myc can cause
	proliferative inhibition, i.e. mitoinhibition. The c-Myc-induced
	PCD and mitoinhibition, which may be attributable to its inhibition
	of cyclin D1 and induction of p53, may impose a pressure of compensatory
	proliferation, i.e. regeneration, onto the initiated cells (cancer
	progenitor cells) that occur sporadically and are resistant to the
	mitoinhibition. The initiated cells can thus proliferate robustly
	and progress to a malignancy. This hypothetical thinking, i.e. the
	concurrent PCD and mitoinhibition induced by c-Myc can promote carcinogenesis,
	predicts that an optimal balance is achieved between cell death and
	ensuing regeneration during oncogenic transformation by c-Myc, which
	can better promote carcinogenesis. In this perspective, we summarize
	accumulating evidence and challenge the current model that oncoprotein
	induces carcinogenesis by promoting cellular proliferation and/or
	inhibiting PCD. Inspired by c-myc oncogene, we surmise that many
	tumor-suppressive or growth-inhibitory genes may also be able to
	promote carcinogenesis in a similar way, i.e. by inducing PCD and/or
	mitoinhibition of normal cells to create a need for compensatory
	proliferation that drives a robust replication of initiating cells.},

@article{wang:PhysLifeRev:2015,
	abstract = {Why would natural selection favor the prevalence of cooperation within
	the groups of selfish individuals? A fruitful framework to address
	this question is evolutionary game theory, the essence of which is
	captured in the so-called social dilemmas. Such dilemmas have sparked
	the development of a variety of mathematical approaches to assess
	the conditions under which cooperation evolves. Furthermore, borrowing
	from statistical physics and network science, the research of the
	evolutionary game dynamics has been enriched with phenomena such
	as pattern formation, equilibrium selection, and self-organization.
	Numerous advances in understanding the evolution of cooperative behavior
	over the last few decades have recently been distilled into five
	reciprocity mechanisms: direct reciprocity, indirect reciprocity,
	kin selection, group selection, and network reciprocity. However,
	when social viscosity is introduced into a population via any of
	the reciprocity mechanisms, the existing scaling parameters for the
	dilemma strength do not yield a unique answer as to how the evolutionary
	dynamics should unfold. Motivated by this problem, we review the
	developments that led to the present state of affairs, highlight
	the accompanying pitfalls, and propose new universal scaling parameters
	for the dilemma strength. We prove universality by showing that the
	conditions for an ESS and the expressions for the internal equilibriums
	in an infinite, well-mixed population subjected to any of the five
	reciprocity mechanisms depend only on the new scaling parameters.
	A similar result is shown to hold for the fixation probability of
	the different strategies in a finite, well-mixed population. Furthermore,
	by means of numerical simulations, the same scaling parameters are
	shown to be effective even if the evolution of cooperation is considered
	on the spatial networks (with the exception of highly heterogeneous
	setups). We close the discussion by suggesting promising directions
	for future research including (i) how to handle the dilemma strength
	in the context of co-evolution and (ii) where to seek opportunities
	for applying the game theoretical approach with meaningful impact.},

	stem-like cells, where cure is thought to require eradication of
	this cell population. In this study, we investigated the dynamics
	of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) before and during therapy with
	regard to disease initiation, progression, and therapeutic response.
	This investigation used a mathematical model of hematopoiesis and
	a dataset derived from the North American Intergroup Study INT0129.
	The known phenotypic constraints of APL could be explained by a combination
	of differentiation blockade of PML-RARα-positive cells and suppression
	of normal hematopoiesis. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) neutralizes
	the differentiation block and decreases the proliferation rate of
	leukemic stem cells in vivo. Prolonged ATRA treatment after chemotherapy
	can cure patients with APL by eliminating the stem-like cell population
	over the course of approximately one year. To our knowledge, this
	study offers the first estimate of the average duration of therapy
	that is required to eliminate stem-like cancer cells from a human
	tumor, with the potential for the refinement of treatment strategies
	to better manage human malignancy.},

In particular, we analyze the shape of telomere length distributions underlying stem cell behavior within individuals. Our mathematical model shows that these distributions contain a fingerprint of the progressive telomere loss and the fraction of symmetric cell proliferations. Our predictions are tested against measured telomere length distributions in humans across all ages, collected from lymphocyte and granulocyte sorted telomere length data of 356 healthy individuals, including 47 cord blood and 28 bone marrow samples. We find an increasing stem cell pool during childhood and adolescence and an approximately maintained stem cell population in adults. Furthermore, our method is able to detect individual differences from a single tissue sample, i.e. a single snapshot. Prospectively, this allows us to compare cell proliferation between individuals and identify abnormal stem cell dynamics, which affects the risk of stem cell related diseases.},

@article{woo:CTK:1980,
	abstract = {The in vitro proliferation kinetics of a cell line derived from a
	patient with American Burkitt's lymphoma were investigated at three
	different growth phases: lag (day 1), exponential (day 3) and plateau
	(day 5). The growth curve, labeling and mitotic indices, percentage
	labeled mitosis (PLM) curves and DNA content distributions were determined.
	The data obtained have been analysed by the previously developed
	discrete-time kinetic (DTK) model by which a time course of DNA distributions
	during a 10-day growth period was characterized in terms of other
	cell kinetic parameters. The mean cell cycle times, initially estimated
	from PLM curves on days 1, 3 and 5, were further analysed by the
	DTK model of DNA distributions and subsequently the mean cell cycle
	times with respect to DNA distributions during the entire growth
	period were determined. The doubling times were 39.6, 31.2 and 67.2
	hr, respectively, at days 1, 3 and 5. The mean cell cycle time increased
	from 23.0 to 37.7 hr from day 3 to day 5 mainly due to an elongation
	of the G1 and G2 phases. A slight increase in the cell loss rate
	from 0.0077 to 0.0081 fraction/hr was accompanied by a decrease in
	the cell production rate from 0.0299 to 0.0184 fraction/hr. This
	calculated cell loss rate correlated significantly with the number
	of dead cells determined by trypan blue exclusion. Analysis of the
	number of dead cells in relation to the cell cycle stage revealed
	that a majority of cell death occurred in G1 (r + 0.908; P < 0.0001).

	the in vivo proliferation kinetics of African Burkitt's lymphoma
	(Iversen et al., 1974), suggesting the potential utility of information

	and plant populations, yet the population dynamics of this kind of
	biological invasion remain poorly understood. Here, we consider the
	epidemiological and evolutionary processes underlying the initial
	introduction and subsequent spread of a pathogen in a new host population,
	with special reference to pathogens that originate by jumping from
	one host species to another. We conclude that, although pathogen
	emergence is inherently unpredictable, emerging pathogens tend to
	share some common traits, and that directly transmitted {RNA} viruses
	might be the pathogens that are most likely to jump between host
	species.},

@article{zaburlin:FEV:2017,
	abstract = {Latent period, burst time, and burst size, kinetic parameters of phage infection characteristic of a given phage/host system, have been measured for a wide variety of lactic acid bacteria. However, most studies to date were conducted in optimal growth conditions of host bacteria and did not consider variations due to changes in external factors. In this work, we determined the effect of temperature, pH, and starvation on kinetic parameters of phages infecting Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides. For kinetics assessment, one-step growth curves were carried out in MRS broth at optimal conditions (control), lower temperature, pH 6.0 and 5.0 (MRS6 and MRS5, respectively), or in medium lacking carbon (MRSN) or nitrogen (MRSC) sources. Phage infection was progressively impaired as environmental conditions were modified from optimal. At lower temperature or pH, infection was delayed, as perceived by longer latent and burst times. Burst size, however, was lower, equal or higher than for controls, but this effect was highly dependent on the particular phage--host system studied. Phage infection was strongly inhibited in MRSC, but only mildly impaired in MRSN. Nevertheless, growth of all the bacterial strains tested was severely compromised by starvation, without significant differences between MRSC and MRSN, indicating that nitrogen compounds are specifically required for a successful phage infection, beyond their influence on bacterial growth.},

	abstract = {The karyotypes of cells from 10 Burkitt lymphoma (BL) biopsies, eight
	cell lines established from BL and nine cell lines from non-BL sources
	were studied by chromosome banding techniques. With the exception
	of the BL-derived cell lines BJAB, GC-BJAB, Maku and U-8691 all biopsies
	and lines of Burkitt origin contained an extra band at the distal
	region of the long arm of one chromosome 14. An extra band on chromosome
	14 was also found in cells of one non-BL biopsy, in cells from a
	lymphosarcoma-derived cell line and in a long-established cell line
	derived from the pleural exudate of a patient with Hodgkin's disease.
	A distal region at the long arm of one chromosome 8 was missing in
	all metaphase figures of good technical quality in the same material.
	The size, morphology and stain-ability of the missing region corresponded
	fairly well to the extra region at chromosome 14. We therefore suggest
	that the chromosome 14 marker represents a translocation between
	chromosomes 8 and 14,t (8q-; 14q+). The translocation was present
	neither in lymphocytes of the peripheral blood of five Burkitt patients
	nor in five lymphoblastoid cell lines of non-BL origin. Trisomy 7
	was found in two of the 10 BL biopsies, in two BL-derived cell lines,
	in one non-BL biopsy, in two lymphosarcoma-derived cell lines and
	in one cell line derived from a patient with Hodgkin's disease.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Strong reciprocity, defined as a predisposition to help
	others and to punish those that are not helping, has been proposed
	as a potent force leading to the evolution of cooperation and altruism.
	However, the conditions under which strong reciprocity might be favored
	are not clear. Here we investigate the selective pressure on strong
	reciprocity by letting both limited dispersal (i.e., spatial structure)
	and recombination between helping and punishment jointly determine
	the evolutionary dynamics of strong reciprocity. Our analytical model
	suggests that when helping and punishment are perfectly linked traits
	(no recombination occurring between them), strong reciprocity can
	spread even when the initial frequency of strong reciprocators is
	close to 0 in the population (i.e., a rare mutant can invade). By
	contrast, our results indicate that when recombination can occur
	between helping and punishment (i.e., both traits coevolve) and is
	stronger than selection, punishment is likely to invade a population
	of defectors only when it gives a direct fitness benefit to the actor.
	Overall, our results delineate the conditions under which strong
	reciprocity is selected for in a spatially structured population
	and highlight that the forces behind its evolution involves kinship
	(be it genetic or cultural).},

	abstract = {During eukaryotic cellular protein synthesis, ribosomal translation is made more efficient through interaction between the two ends of the messenger RNA (mRNA). Ribosomes reaching the 3' end of the mRNA can thus recycle and begin translation again on the same mRNA, the so-called {\textquoteleft}closed-loop{\textquoteright} model. Using a driven diffusion lattice model of translation, we study the effects of ribosome recycling on the dynamics of ribosome flow and density on the mRNA. We show that ribosome recycling induces a substantial increase in ribosome current. Furthermore, for sufficiently large values of the recycling rate, the lattice does not transition directly from low to high ribosome density, as seen in lattice models without recycling. Instead, a maximal current phase becomes accessible for much lower values of the initiation rate, and multiple phase transitions occur over a wide region of the phase plane. Crucially, we show that in the presence of ribosome recycling, mRNAs can exhibit a peak in protein production at low values of the initiation rate, beyond which translation rate decreases. This has important implications for translation of certain mRNAs, suggesting that there is an optimal concentration of ribosomes at which protein synthesis is maximal, and beyond which translational efficiency is impaired.},

To achieve this remarkable task, they can undergo an intrinsically asymmetric cell division whereby they segregate cell fate determinants into only one of the two daughter cells. Alternatively, they can orient their division plane so that only one of the two daughter cells maintains contact with the niche and stem cell identity. These distinct pathways have been elucidated mostly in Drosophila. Although the molecules involved are highly conserved in vertebrates, the way they act is tissue specific and sometimes very different from invertebrates. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Unravelling these distinct contributions to the aged phenotype will be critical to the success of any therapeutic application of stem cells in the emerging field of regenerative medicine with respect to tissue injury, degenerative diseases or normal functional declines that accompany ageing.},

	abstract = {Treatment with a combination of cytokines and chemotherapy can effectively stimulate the release of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) into the peripheral blood (PB), which can then be harvested for transplantation. The cell cycle status of the harvested HSC from mobilized PB (MPB) is of interest because of the impact that cell cycling may have on optimizing the conditions for ex vivo expansion, retrovirus-mediated gene transfer, and the engraftment of transplanted tissues. Therefore, we characterized the cell cycling status of mobilized HSC from mice and humans. The murine HSC, which express the phenotype c-kit+ Thy-1.1lo Lin-/lo Sca-1+, were purified from PB, bone marrow (BM), and spleen after the mice were treated with the mobilizing regimen of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or a combination of cyclophosphamide (CTX) and G-CSF. Human HSC (CD34+ Thy-1+ Lin-) and progenitor cells (CD34+ Thy-1-Lin-) were isolated from the BM of untreated healthy volunteers and from MPB of healthy volunteers and patients treated with G-CSF or a combination of CTX and GM-CSF. Cell cycle status was determined by quantitating the amount of DNA in the purified cells after staining with the dye Hoechst 33342. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of the progenitor cells from the murine and human samples showed an unexpected finding, ie, virtually none of the cells from the MPB was cycling. The G0/G1 status of HSC from MPB was surprising, because a significant proportion of HSC from BM are actively proliferating and, after mobilization, the HSC in the spleen and BM were also actively cycling.},

	abstract = {Hematopoietic stem cells in mammals are known to reside mostly in the bone marrow, but also transitively passage in small numbers in the blood. Experimental findings have suggested that they exist in a dynamic equilibrium, continuously migrating between these two compartments. Here we construct an individual-based mathematical model of this process, which is parametrised using existing empirical findings from mice. This approach allows us to quantify the amount of migration between the bone marrow niches and the peripheral blood. We use this model to investigate clonal hematopoiesis, which is a significant risk factor for hematologic cancers. We also analyse the engraftment of donor stem cells into non-conditioned and conditioned hosts, quantifying the impact of different treatment scenarios. The simplicity of the model permits a thorough mathematical analysis, providing deeper insights into the dynamics of both the model and of the real-world system. We predict the time taken for mutant clones to expand within a host, as well as chimerism levels that can be expected following transplantation therapy, and the probability that a preconditioned host is reconstituted by donor cells.},

@article{kumar:Oncogene:2012,
	abstract = {There is enormous interest to target cancer stem cells (CSCs) for clinical treatment because these cells are highly tumorigenic and resistant to chemotherapy. Oct4 is expressed by CSC-like cells in different types of cancer. However, function of Oct4 in tumor cells is unclear. In this study, we showed that expression of Oct4 gene or transmembrane delivery of Oct4 protein promoted dedifferentiation of melanoma cells to CSC-like cells. The dedifferentiated melanoma cells showed significantly decreased expression of melanocytic markers and acquired the ability to form tumor spheroids. They showed markedly increased resistance to chemotherapeutic agents and hypoxic injury. In the subcutaneous xenograft and tail vein injection assays, these cells had significantly increased tumorigenic capacity. The dedifferentiated melanoma cells acquired features associated with CSCs such as multipotent differentiation capacity and expression of melanoma CSC markers such as ABCB5 and CD271. Mechanistically, Oct4-induced dedifferentiation was associated with increased expression of endogenous Oct4, Nanog and Klf4, and global gene expression changes that enriched for transcription factors. RNAi-mediated knockdown of Oct4 in dedifferentiated cells led to diminished CSC phenotypes. Oct4 expression in melanoma was regulated by hypoxia and its expression was detected in a sub-population of melanoma cells in clinical samples. Our data indicate that Oct4 is a positive regulator of tumor dedifferentiation. The results suggest that CSC phenotype is dynamic and may be acquired through dedifferentiation. Oct4-mediated tumor cell dedifferentiation may have an important role during tumor progression.},
